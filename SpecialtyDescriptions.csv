0,Gynecology,"What does a gynecologist do?
A gynecologist is a doctor who specializes in women's reproductive health.
That is, a gynecologist is a specialist with expertise treating issues or conditions affecting a woman's reproductive system, including:
Vagina
Cervix
Uterus
Ovaries
Fallopian tubes
Breasts
A gynecologist also performs Pap smears, pelvic exams and other types of preventive care that begin at age 21 as part of your annual well-woman exam.

When should you see a gynecologist?
From your well-woman exam to issues that may signal a visit is needed before then, here are seven signs it's time to see a gynecologist.
1. Abnormal or painful periods
Whether it's cramping, bleeding or something else, period symptoms never really feel ""normal.""
But when are they truly abnormal and worrisome?
""Your period can be affected by many things, from travel and stress to new medications and weight changes,"" Dr. Peakes explains. ""Having a period that's a little heavier or longer than usual every once in a while isn't a huge concern. Usually the cycle will correct itself on its own over the next month or so.""
But if the abnormality continues, an appointment with your gynecologist is important.
""If several periods in a row are significantly worse than usual, it could be a sign that something else is going on,"" warns Dr. Peakes.
Some women develop endometriosis — when uterine tissue gets implanted in the fallopian tubes, ovaries or pelvic lining and causes serious pelvic pain — or uterine fibroids, noncancerous uterine growths that can cause pain and heavier menses.
An abnormal period may look and feel like: 
Heavier-than-usual bleeding 
Heavy cramping with and before the cycle 
Bleeding that lasts longer than a week 
Bleeding that comes, unexpectedly, on other days or weeks
Schedule a visit with your gynecologist if you're frequently getting abnormal periods.
2. Irregular vaginal bleeding
Bleeding between periods isn't always cause for alarm.
For instance, some women have spotting with each ovulation. Other women will experience spotting when starting a new birth control pill. If you miss a dose of your birth control pill, this too can cause irregular bleeding. During the years leading into menopause, lots of women will have cycle irregularity.
There are times when vaginal bleeding is irregular and concerning, including: 
Unexplained bleeding between periods 
Bleeding while pregnant 
Bleeding after menopause
""In particular, we take bleeding after menopause very seriously,"" Dr. Peakes notes. ""Post-menopausal bleeding doesn't always mean cancer, but it can — so we don't take any chances. We try to begin the evaluation very quickly and efficiently.""
3. Pelvic pain
Dr. Peakes emphasizes that if you're experiencing pelvic pain during certain activities, like exercise or intercourse, it's definitely time to see your gynecologist.
Other symptoms that may accompany pelvic pain include feeling bloated or a heaviness in your abdomen, and even fever and vomiting in more severe cases.
Stay up-to-date
""Pelvic pain can be a sign of an ovarian cyst, a fluid-filled sac that can form in the ovaries,"" Dr. Peakes explains. ""Many women will wait until the pain is severe enough to send them to the emergency room, where usually a CT scan or pelvic ultrasound will then show the presence of an ovarian cyst.""
It's important to follow up on these cysts. Most cysts are benign, but your gynecologist needs to confirm that the cyst does not appear concerning or cancerous.
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can also cause acute pelvic pain. This occurs when infection develops in the uterus and fallopian tubes, and it needs to be treated right away with IV or oral antibiotics to help preserve fertility.
Again, endometriosis can also cause pelvic pain, but the pain is more chronic, developing over months to years.
""There are many ways to treat endometriosis, including both medication and surgery, so a follow-up with your gynecologist is in order at that point,"" adds Dr. Peakes.
4. Menopause symptoms
""Another very common reason for women to see a gynecologist is to get questions about menopause answered,"" says Dr. Peakes. ""We talk about what symptoms are normal and abnormal, as well as what else to potentially expect during this phase of life.""
(Related: When Does Menopause Usually Start?)
Ideally, a woman's hormones are tested prior to consulting a gynecologist about perimenopause, so the appointment can be dedicated to discussing how best to manage the hormonal findings and most significant symptoms.
5. Breast pain or lumps
A mammogram or breast ultrasound is almost always needed to diagnose if a breast pain or a breast lump is serious, but Dr. Peakes says that your gynecologist can help evaluate you in the meantime and help you know the urgency of getting breast imaging.
""Aside from a breast infection while breastfeeding, most breast issues need follow-up evaluation by a radiologist before any diagnosis can be made,"" Dr. Peakes adds. ""But we can feel the lump or assess the pain and help you understand what to do next.""
6. Urinary issues
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in women, and your gynecologist is well-versed in helping manage this uncomfortable, annoying issue.
Dr. Peakes says that UTI symptoms can often be assessed and antibiotics can be prescribed over the phone.
""But if you've taken your antibiotics and don't feel like your symptoms are improving, that's worthy of a trip to the clinic,"" Dr. Peakes says.
While your gynecologist can handle simple UTIs, more complex situations, like recurrent UTIs, will likely result in referral to a urologist.
7. You're due for your well woman exam
A well-woman exam is your annual checkup with your gynecologist.
The visit may also include a Pap smear, breast exam and pelvic exam — depending on your age, recommended screening guidelines and risk for gynecologic issues.
""With HPV testing and vaccination, we don't do a Pap smear every single year for every woman,"" says Dr. Peakes. ""Sometimes every two or three years is sufficient. But this is something your doctor will determine based on your age and individual risk.""
And even if you're not due for a Pap smear, don't skip your annual checkup with your gynecologist, Dr. Peakes stresses.
""From regular pelvic and breast exams to recommending the other types of preventive care you may need — like mammograms, bone density testing and colorectal cancer screening — your annual well woman exam is an important way to stay on top of your health,""
Your vaginal symptoms may not need any treatment. Or you may have a mild infection that is easy to treat. But without a gynecologist’s attention, even a mild infection can become a bigger problem. Also, vaginal symptoms sometimes are a sign of more serious conditions.
Here are nine symptoms and situations that warrant a trip to the gynecologist as soon as possible.
1. Painful periods. Monthly menstrual periods are really uncomfortable for many women. Lower belly cramps, sore breasts, and headaches can make those several days seem to last forever. But what if a period becomes even more painful, for a longer time? That could point to endometriosis (when extra tissue builds up outside of your uterus and causes bleeding and swelling) or fibroids (growths of cells and tissue in the uterus).
A gynecologist can diagnose these conditions and help with a treatment plan.
2. Vaginal bleeding. It’s normal for women to have spotting in the first few months after starting certain birth control methods and to experience heavier periods as they near menopause. But if you have unexpected vaginal bleeding -- for example, after menopause -- then you should see a gynecologist to find out why.
3. Starting or resuming sex. A gynecologist can make you aware of risks you should consider. For example, if you are under 18 or think you will have sex with more than one person, then you have a greater risk of getting cancer from an HPV infection. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted virus.
Certain sexually transmitted diseases also raise your chances of infertility and cancer. A gynecologist will remind you of that risk if you want to resume sex after treatment for the STD.
4. Bumps and blisters. If you see or feel a bump in your vagina or a blister in or around your labia (the skin folds around the vagina), then it’s a good idea to contact a gynecologist. The bump may be no more than an ingrown hair, but it also might be a genital wart, which is a small swelling caused by an STD. A small but painful blister that vanishes in a couple of weeks but returns could be a lesion that accompanies genital herpes.
5. Breast issues. A gynecologist can advise whether a new lump, sensitivity, or discharge in your breast is cause for concern about cancer. Most of the time, these conditions are not cancerous, especially if you haven’t gone through menopause.
6. Vaginal odor. Have you noticed a smell coming from your vagina that is particularly unpleasant? Or has your normal odor from that area changed in a way that isn’t so disagreeable but lasts for days? You should tell your gynecologist, even if the conversation makes you uncomfortable. You might be dealing with bacterial growth or a vaginal infection that needs prescription medication to cure.
7. Discomfort during sex. This is another topic that can be hard to discuss, but a gynecologist is very familiar with the issue. Say you are experiencing dryness during sex. If you are younger, your gynecologist may change your birth control prescription to include more of a sex hormone called estrogen. If you have already gone through menopause, your doctor may prescribe vaginal estrogen or recommend types of lubricants.
8. Low libido. Sometimes a medical condition or medication you take reduces your interest in sex as a side effect. Work or family stress, as well as the length of your relationship, also can rob you of your desire. A gynecologist can diagnose why your libido has left and recommend steps to help restore it.
9. Incontinence. Women of any age can become incontinent (have accidental leakage of urine or feces), but it’s more common in the 50s and 60s and after menopause. Also, it can happen after childbirth, especially if the baby was large or the doctor needed to use forceps or a vacuum. A gynecologist can suggest treatments such as behavioral therapy or muscle relaxation, diet change, medication, or surgery, or refer you to a specialist. 
Bleeding between periods 
Frequent and urgent need to urinate, or a burning sensation during urination 
Abnormal vaginal bleeding 
Bleeding after menopause 
Pain or pressure in your pelvis that differs from menstrual cramps 
Itching, burning, swelling, redness, or soreness in the vaginal area 
Sores or lumps in the genital area 
Vaginal discharge with an unpleasant or unusual odor, or of an unusual color 
Increased vaginal discharge"
1,Otorhinolaryngology,"An otolaryngologist, or ENT, is a healthcare specialist who treats conditions affecting your ears, nose and throat. They can also perform head and neck surgeries, including surgeries on your ears, mouth, throat, nose, neck and face.
Another name for an otolaryngologist is ENT, which stands for “ear, nose and throat.” Both terms mean the same thing. 
What does an otolaryngologist do?
An otolaryngologist diagnoses and treats conditions affecting your head and neck. These conditions range from mild (such as a cough and runny nose) to serious (such as head and neck cancer).
Why would you see an otolaryngologist?
There are many reasons why someone might need to see an otolaryngologist. Your primary care physician (PCP) may refer you to an otolaryngologist if you develop certain symptoms, including:
Persistent sore throat.
Runny nose that doesn’t go away.
Chronic cough.
Chronic sinus pressure or nasal congestion.
Dizziness.
Vertigo.
Severe allergies.
Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).
Hearing loss.
Hoarseness or wheezing that doesn’t go away.
Frequent ear infections.
Chronic tonsillitis.
A lump on your face or neck.
Severe snoring.
Sleep apnea.
What diseases does an ENT diagnose?
An ENT diagnoses and treats infections and diseases of your ears, nose and throat. But they also treat a wide range of other conditions affecting your head and neck region.
Ear conditions
Otolaryngologists treat ear conditions, including:
Ear infections, including those in your outer, middle or inner ear.
Tinnitus, or ringing in your ears.
Dizziness, a feeling of unbalance which often results from inner ear disorders.
Vertigo. Different from dizziness, vertigo is when you have a sensation that your surroundings are spinning.
Ruptured eardrum, or a hole in your tympanic membrane.
Eustachian tube dysfunction, when the tubes that connect your middle ears to your upper throat become blocked.
Otosclerosis, or abnormal bone growth in your middle ear.
Ménière’s disease, a rare inner ear disorder that affects your hearing and sense of balance.
Hearing loss, which can range from mild to severe.
Nose conditions
Common nose conditions that otolaryngologists treat include:
Sinusitis, which is inflammation or infection of your sinuses (air passages around your nose and forehead that drain mucus).
Allergies, which can result from pollen, pet dander or other environmental irritants.
Rhinitis, or inflammation of the mucus membranes that line your nose.
Nosebleeds, which may result from infections, allergies or trauma, among other things.
Postnasal drip, which happens when excess mucus builds up and drips down the back of your throat.
Deviated septum, a condition in which your septum (the cartilage that separates your nasal cavity) is off-center.
Nasal polyps, which are noncancerous growths common in people with chronic allergies, asthma or sinus infections.
Nasal and paranasal tumors. Tumors inside your nose may be cancerous or noncancerous.
Throat conditions
Otolaryngologists also treat throat conditions, including:
Sore throat, which may result from infections, allergies or exposure to certain irritants.
Tonsillitis, or infection of your tonsils.
Laryngitis, or swelling of your voice box.
Swallowing issues. Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) may result from a condition in your mouth, throat or esophagus.
Vocal cord conditions, including vocal nodules, vocal cord dysfunction or vocal cord paralysis.
Sleep disorders
Otolaryngologists commonly treat sleep-related conditions, including:
Snoring. Severe snoring can occur when the soft tissues in your upper airway relax too much during sleep. When air moves through these narrowed tissues, it results in loud vibrations.
Obstructive sleep apnea. This type of sleep apnea happens as a result of relaxed tissues in your airway. Your airway can narrow or close off completely, leading to apneic episodes (where you temporarily stop breathing during sleep).
Tumors of your head and neck
Otolaryngologists can surgically treat head and neck tumors (both cancerous and noncancerous). Examples include:
Hemangiomas. These noncancerous growths contain extra blood vessels. Anyone can get hemangiomas, but they’re most common in newborn babies.
Salivary gland tumors, which may be cancerous or noncancerous.
Oral cancer, the most common form of head and neck cancer. It can affect your lips, inner cheeks, tongue and floor or roof of your mouth.
Oropharyngeal, which affects the middle part of your throat, which affects your larynx (voice box).
Nasopharyngeal, which affects your nasopharynx — the upper part of your throat that connects your nose to the rest of your respiratory system.
Thyroid cancer, which affects your thyroid gland. Your thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck that makes hormones.
1. Chronic ear infections
This condition is an infection in the air-filled space behind the eardrum. Some people are more prone to getting ear infections. Kids 6 months to 2 years are most susceptible to infections because of the size and shape of their middle ears and eustachian tubes.
Often ear infections are a result of another illness that causes congestion and swelling, such as a cold, flu or allergies. Ear infections can be painful, and cause impaired hearing, fever, headache and loss of balance.
If your child develops multiple ear infections, it may be time to talk with an ENT provider. Ear infections can affect their ability to hear clearly, so recurrent infections could result in speech, social and developmental delays.
Ear tubes are a common treatment for chronic ear infections. During this procedure, an ENT surgeon creates a tiny hole in the eardrum to suction out fluid from the middle ear. Then a tiny tube is placed in the opening to ventilate the ear and prevent the buildup of fluid in the future. Usually, tubes remain in place for four to 18 months and will fall out on their own.
2. Hearing loss
If you find yourself turning up the volume on your devices or feel like voices are too soft or mumbling, it may be time to talk with an ENT provider about your hearing. ENT providers work together with audiologists to discover the cause of your hearing loss, ranging from ear infection and a buildup of earwax to ruptured eardrum or damage to your inner ear.
Also, if you notice rapid hearing loss all at once or over a few days, you should be evaluated by an ENT provider and audiologist within a few days to a week after noticing the hearing loss. This may be related to what is called ""sudden sensorineural hearing loss.""
3. Dizziness or vertigo
Many body systems, including your inner ear, must work together to maintain balance. About 30% of people in the U.S. experience dizziness or vertigo at some point in their lives. It could be a short-term concern, such as occurring after standing up too quickly, when taking a medication or during a migraine.
The most common cause of vertigo is when calcium crystals in your inner ear become dislodged from their normal position. This is called ""benign paroxysmal positional vertigo."" People often experience symptoms with changes in head position, such as bending over, looking up or rolling over in bed. An ENT provider can help develop a treatment plan to steady your footing and ease your symptoms.
4. Ringing in the ears
Tinnitus is commonly referred to as ringing in the ears. This is a recurrent ear or head noise with no external source that lasts longer than five minutes and happens more than once per week. For some people, tinnitus can be extremely bothersome and negatively affect the quality of their lives. While there is no cure for tinnitus, an ENT provider can help with many management strategies to decrease your perception of the ringing sound.
5. Chronic stuffy nose
Sinusitis occurs when your sinuses become swollen and inflamed. This swelling interferes with the way mucus normally drains and makes your nose stuffy. You may find it difficult to breathe through your nose, have discolored discharge from your nose or feel tender around the eyes. Long-lasting sinusitis, also called ""chronic sinusitis,"" is classified by a history of sinus infections that don't respond to treatment or symptoms that last longer than three months.
Common causes of chronic sinusitis include nasal polyps, deviated nasal septum, repeated respiratory infections, allergies or complications of other conditions. An ENT provider can help determine the best treatment option to help ease your symptoms including medications, antibiotics or surgery.
6. Chronic sore throat or tonsillitis
Tonsillitis is inflammation of the tonsils, two oval-shaped pads of tissue at the back of the throat. Symptoms include swollen tonsils, sore throat, difficulty swallowing and tender lymph nodes on the sides of the neck.
Because appropriate treatment for tonsillitis depends on the cause, it's important to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis. Surgery to remove tonsils, once a common procedure to treat tonsillitis, is usually performed only when tonsillitis occurs frequently, doesn't respond to other treatments or causes serious complications.
7. Lumps in the neck/enlarged lymph nodes
Your lymph nodes, also called lymph glands, play a vital role in your body's ability to fight off infections. You have many lymph nodes in your head and neck. They can become swollen or feel tender, usually due to an infection from bacteria or virus.
Most swollen lymph nodes get better on their own within a few weeks, but you should talk with an ENT provider if the lumps get bigger; are present for more than two weeks; feel hard or rubbery; appear for no apparent reason; are associated with chronic sore throat or voice changes; or you are experiencing a fever, night sweats or unexplained weight loss.
8. Sleep apnea
Sleep apnea is a serious condition where you repeatedly stop breathing or breathe shallowly while sleeping. When this happens, you may snore loudly or make choking noises as you try to breathe. Your brain and body become oxygen-deprived, and you may wake up. More than 18 million adults in the U.S. have sleep apnea, and many cases are undiagnosed.
An ENT provider may request that you complete a sleep study to measure how well you sleep and how your body responds to sleep problems. This test can help your health care team find out if you have a sleep disorder, how severe it is and the best treatment option for you."
2,Ophthalmology,"You don’t want to take any chances of losing your vision. This is why it’s smart to know when you need to visit an eye doctor. Here are a few signs that you might need to book an appointment with a specialist:
Blurry Vision
Sudden changes in vision can happen for a variety of reasons. If you notice that your eyesight is changing, it’s essential to schedule an eye exam to determine the diagnosis.
Also, pay attention to symptoms that are causing difficulty with eye focusing – especially if the symptoms are only affecting one eye.  
Even if it is as simple as a change in your prescription lenses, it’s important that you don’t delay a visit with an eye care expert. Instead, make an appointment with an ophthalmologist to rule out serious complications and determine the reason why your vision is changing.
Vision Disturbances
Sudden disturbances in your vision could be a sign of serious eye issues that need to be treated immediately. Examples include obstructions in your vision, flashes of light, black spots, dark shadows, or floaters. These symptoms could be an indication of a retinal hole, tear, or detachment – which requires emergency treatment.
If there is a serious cause for these disturbances, you should see medical attention without delay. Treatment within the first 24 hours could reduce your risk of vision loss.
Double Vision
Some causes of double vision can be severe issues, which is why it’s critical that you talk to an ophthalmologist without delay. For example, double vision could be an indicator of a bigger health problem, such as issues with blood vessels in the brain or a stroke.
Eye Pain
If your eyes hurt, it is a potential sign of an underlying condition. For example, serious eye diseases that cause eye pain can lead to permanent vision loss in just a few days. So, don’t wait until the pain goes away – it’s essential that you schedule an eye exam as quickly as possible.
Pay attention to other symptoms that are associated with the pain. Examples include vomiting, nausea, and headache. Also, keep in mind that eye strain or infrequent pain usually isn’t a cause for concern. But it never hurts to consult with an ophthalmologist to rule out more serious complications.
A foreign object in the eye can also cause eye pain. An eye doctor can help to remove the object and prevent additional damage.
Color Change in the White Areas of the Eye
You should be able to see a white color in the eyes, but this white can change to pink or red. A change in color could be an indication of a more severe condition, such as an infection or allergies.
A change in the white part of the eye might require services from an eye care specialist. Unfortunately, your primary care provider has limited experience and knowledge about potentially complicated eye conditions. So, the best solution is to book an appointment with an ophthalmologist for diagnosis.
Difficulty Driving or Seeing at Night
If you notice that your vision is starting to change when you are driving at night, then it’s one of the first signs that you should talk to an ophthalmologist. Distance and dark vision are conditions that make mild vision loss most noticeable.
The solution might be as simple as getting new glasses or contact lenses. Or, you might have early signs of a more serious eye condition, such as glaucoma or cataracts.
Light Sensitivity
Do you find yourself flinching or closing your eyes when exposed to light? Often, light sensitivity is an indication that there is inflammation within the eye.
Certain eye diseases that cause light sensitivity can lead to scarring on the eye. So, it’s essential to seek treatment immediately. On the other hand, there are conditions that might be unrelated, such as a migraine headache, virus, or allergies.
Dry Eyes
Symptoms associated with dry eyes can range from mild discomfort to chronic issues that disrupt your daily activities. For example, you might feel like your eyes are gritty or sticky.
One interesting symptom to note is that dry eyes can sometimes manifest with too many tears: your eyes won’t stop watering. This symptom could be an indication of poor-quality tears because of an improper balance in the delicate tear production system.
Dry eyes are usually a symptom of other underlying issues, such as medication side effects or allergies. Or, you might need an adjustment to the way you are wearing contact lenses.
If you are experiencing chronic dry eyes, it’s a good idea to talk to an ophthalmologist to get to the bottom of the issue.
Time for an Eye Exam
When was the last time you had a comprehensive eye exam? If it’s been longer than a year, it’s time to book an appointment with an ophthalmologist.
Annual vision screenings are essential to healthy living. In the same way that you visit a primary care physician for a yearly checkup, it’s also crucial to see an ophthalmologist to examine your visual health.

3,Pulmonology,"A pulmonologist is a physician who specializes in the respiratory system. From the windpipe to the lungs, if your complaint involves the lungs or any part of the respiratory system, a pulmonologist is the doc you want to solve the problem.
A simple cough associated with allergies or a cold shouldn't send you looking for a pulmonary specialist. Urgent care or your primary care doctor should be your first stop, and then on to an allergist or ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.
You should see a pulmonologist if that cough persists for more than 3 weeks, or if it becomes severe. This should be done in consultation with your primary care doctor.
When else should you see a pulmonologist? The below symptoms can be related to a lung condition and a pulmonary specialist may be helpful:
Chest pain or tightness
Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting
Difficulty breathing, especially during exercise
Fatigue
Wheezing
Recurring or chronic bronchitis or colds that impact your respiratory system
Asthma that isn't well-controlled, or has unidentified triggers
Some illnesses treated or managed by pulmonologists include, but aren’t limited to:
Aspergillosis
Asthma.
Bronchiectasis.
Bronchitis.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
COVID-19.
Cystic fibrosis.
Emphysema.
Interstitial lung disease.
Lung cancer.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Sarcoidosis.
Sleep apnea.
Tuberculosis.
A pulmonologist can also treat occupation-related lung diseases like:
Asbestosis.
Chronic beryllium disease (berylliosis)
Coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (black lung disease).
Silicosis.
Why would you need to see a pulmonologist?
If you have symptoms that your regular healthcare provider isn’t able to help you with, or if they think you would be better off seeing a specialist, they might refer you to a pulmonologist. Some of these signs and symptoms might include:
A cough that doesn’t improve over time (chronic cough).
Shortness of breath (dyspnea).
Chest pain or tightness.
Wheezing.
Sleep apnea symptoms, like extreme tiredness or loud snoring.
Dizziness.
If you’ve already been diagnosed with a respiratory condition, you may continue having scheduled appointments to manage your illness.
Pulmonary hypertension is when pressure increases in the arteries inside your lungs. Having high blood pressure in your lungs also affects the right side of your heart.
Pulmonary Hypertension Program University of Utah Health
Many different things can cause pulmonary hypertension. University of Utah Health’s Pulmonary Hypertension Program is the only comprehensive care center for pulmonary hypertension in the region. Our role is to identify what's causing your pulmonary hypertension and help you understand your treatment options.
Pulmonary Hypertension Symptoms
Pulmonary hypertension can cause several signs and symptoms that may include the following:
Shortness of breath
Swelling of the legs
Fatigue
Loss of consciousness
Abnormal kidney function (this is when your kidneys don’t work how they should)
1. You Have a Persistent Cough that Isn’t Getting Better
A cough can begin during any type of respiratory infection, including viral, bacterial, or fungal infections. A chronic cough can also be a symptom of lung cancer.
A skilled pulmonary doctor can give you a quick assessment and put you on the path to treatment and recovery. The sooner you have the cough treated, the better it will be for your overall health.
2. You Get Out of Breath Easily with Mild Physical Activity
If you find yourself getting out of breath more easily than before or even when you’re doing routine activities, it may indicate that you have a lung issue. This symptom may indicate bronchitis, arrhythmia, allergies, low oxygen levels, asthma, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, or cancer.
A pulmonary doctor will review your symptoms and health history, and you will be given recommendations and possibly prescription medication to get your breathing back to normal again. You may also be asked to have an imaging scan so the physician can check the condition of your lungs.
3. You Are a Long-Term Smoker
When you smoke, it eventually turns your lungs from a healthy pink color to a dark gray color. Smoking can destroy the alveoli in your lungs, which are the tiny air sacs that exchange carbon dioxide with fresh oxygen. If these air sacs are depleted, you may develop emphysema, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), chronic bronchitis, and lung cancer.
As many as 90% of lung cancer cases are attributed to smoking. Every smoker should have a pulmonary doctor who will keep tabs on their lung health.
4. You Have Asthma
Asthma occurs when your airways constrict, making it hard for you to breathe. You may wheeze, cough, or have tightness in the chest – especially if you are engaging in some sort of physical activity.
If you have asthma that seems to be getting worse or is periodically severe, it is in your best interest to be partnered with an experienced pulmonologist who can help you keep your asthma under control.
5. You Have Breathing Problems Accompanied by Foot or Leg Swelling
You should seek an evaluation by a lung specialist if you have shortness of breath or other breathing problems along with swelling in your ankle, leg, or foot. These symptoms could indicate pulmonary edema (the accumulation of fluid in your lungs) or pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the arteries in your lungs).

4,Internal Medicine,"Reasons to See an Internist
Signs that a patient needs to see an internal medicine doctor
The list below includes common signs that may make it necessary for patients to make an appointment with an internist.
They have chronic pain
When a patient is experiencing chronic pain, it is likely due to some type of underlying health condition. While an internist can indeed treat patients who are living with chronic pain, they can also treat the underlying condition that is causing the patient to experience ongoing pain. Two common conditions that can cause chronic pain are osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia.
They are experiencing breathing problems
Patients who are experiencing breathing problems are often first diagnosed with a certain condition, like asthma. It also may be possible that a patient has pneumonia when they are experiencing difficulty breathing. If they do, their breathing problems will also include additional symptoms, like a cough, chills and a fever.
They are suffering from digestive issues
Patients who are currently suffering from digestive issues may have a digestive disease. This means they are experiencing health problems occurring somewhere within their digestive tract, which can be something as simple as lactose intolerance or as something as serious as cancer. The fact that digestive issues can be quite serious makes it necessary for patients to get a proper diagnosis as soon as possible in order to understand what treatment options are available to them.
They often feel fatigued
When a patient feels fatigued often, the cause of this extreme lack of energy needs to be understood. Fatigue is definitely a sign that something is wrong and has a number of different causes. Common reasons for feeling fatigued include having a sleeping disorder, having an underactive thyroid or being anemic.
If you’ve chosen an internist as your primary care physician, you'll see your internist for routine care. If you haven’t chosen one as your PCP, you may still see an internist for certain problems.
Here are some reasons you might see a general internist:
Abdominal Pain
Pain in the abdomen can have a variety of causes. It could be from something relatively minor, such as a muscle strain or a stomach virus. More serious illnesses, such as acute appendicitis and several cancers, also cause abdominal pain. You should go to the emergency room for acute pain or if your abdomen is very tender to the touch. For less severe pain, seeing an internist is a good way to start. An internist can help you decide whether your pain is gastrointestinal in nature or caused by something else. 
Chest Pain
Chest pain doesn't always mean you are having a heart attack. It can be caused by problems in the lungs or gastrointestinal system. It could be anxiety or acid reflux. Of course, you should call 911 if you are having symptoms of a heart attack. But for different, less severe chest pain, an internist may be able to diagnose your problem. "
5,Hematology,"A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in researching, diagnosing, treating, and preventing blood disorders and disorders of the lymphatic system (lymph nodes and vessels).
If your primary care physician has recommended that you see a hematologist, it may be because you are at risk for a condition involving your red or white blood cells, platelets, blood vessels, bone marrow, lymph nodes, or spleen. Some of these conditions are:
hemophilia, a disease that prevents your blood from clotting
sepsis, an infection in the blood
leukemia, a cancer that affects blood cells
lymphoma,a cancer that affects the lymph nodes and vessels
sickle cell anemia, a disease that prevents red blood cells from flowing freely through your circulatory system
thalassemia, a condition in which your body doesn’t make enough hemoglobin
anemia, a condition in which there aren’t enough red blood cells in your body
deep vein thrombosis, a condition in which blood clots form inside your veins
If you want to learn more about these disorders and other blood conditions, you can find out more through webinars created by the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTrusted Source (CDC).
The American Society of Hematology can also connect you with support groups, resources, and in-depth information about specific blood disorders.
What kinds of tests do hematologists do?
To diagnose or monitor blood disorders, hematologists often use these tests:
Complete blood count (CBC)
A CBC counts your red and white blood cells, hemoglobin (a blood protein), platelets (tiny cells that clump together to make a blood clot), and hematocrit (the ratio of blood cells to liquid plasma in your blood).
Prothrombin time (PT)
This test measures how long it takes your blood to clot. Your liver produces a protein called prothrombin which helps to form clots. If you’re taking a blood thinner or your doctor suspects that you may have a liver problem, a PT test may help monitor or diagnose your condition.
Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)
Like a prothrombin test, the PTT measures how long your blood takes to clot. If you’re having problematic bleeding anywhere in your body — nosebleeds, heavy periods, pink urine — or if you’re bruising too easily, your doctor can use a PTT to find out whether a blood disorder is causing the problem.
International normalized ratio (INR)
If you take a blood thinner like warfarin, your doctor may compare the results of your blood clotting tests with results from other labs to be sure the medication is working properly and to be sure your liver is healthy. This calculation is known as an international normalized ratio (INR).
Some newer at-home devices allow patients to conduct their own INR testing at home, which has been shown to improve quality of lifeTrusted Source for patients who need to have their blood-clotting speed measured regularly.
Bone marrow biopsy
If your doctor thinks you are not making enough blood cells, you may need a bone marrow biopsy. A specialist will use a small needle to take a bit of bone marrow (a soft substance inside your bones) to be analyzed under a microscope.
Your doctor may use a local anesthetic to numb the area before the bone marrow biopsy. You’ll be awake during this procedure because it’s relatively quick. 
What other procedures do hematologists do?
Hematologists are involved in many of the therapies, treatments, and procedures related to blood and bone marrow. Hematologists do:
ablation therapy (procedures in which abnormal tissue can be eliminated using heat, cold, lasers, or chemicals)
blood transfusions
bone marrow transplants and stem cell donations
cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and biological therapies
growth factor treatments
immunotherapy
Because blood disorders can affect almost any area of the body, hematologists usually collaborate with other medical specialists, especially internists, pathologists, radiologists, and oncologists. 
Blood disorders and cancers have a number of signs (which are observable) or symptoms (reported by the patient) in common.
Among the signs and symptoms of hematologic cancers and blood disorders are:
Bleeding or bruising easily
Frequent infections
Fatigue
Fever
Night sweats
Unexplained weight loss
Bone pain (in myeloma)
Painless swelling of lymph nodes (in lymphoma)
When would I need to see a hematologist?
You may need to see a hematologist because your primary healthcare provider wants a blood specialist to review your blood test results. It’s important to remember that initial blood test results aren’t signs of serious illness.
What are common blood diseases?
We rely on our blood for many things. Red blood cells give our body energy by carrying oxygen to tissues throughout our bodies. White blood cells help our immune system fight infection. Platelets are blood cells that help slow and stop bleeding. Plasma is a liquid that holds your blood cells together.
If you have a blood disease, it means one or more parts of your blood aren’t working as they should. Some blood diseases (disorders) are benign, meaning they aren’t cancer but they’re still serious illnesses.
Benign blood diseases/disorders
A benign blood disease or blood disorder affects your blood but isn’t cancer. Here are some examples:
Anemia: This disease happens when you don’t have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout your body. There are many types of anemia, but the most common type is iron-deficiency anemia.
Von Willebrand Disease: This is the most common bleeding disorder in the United States.
Hemophilia: This is an inherited blood disorder that impairs blood clotting.
Sickle cell anemia: This inherited disorder that affects the shape of red cells
Thalassemias: Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder that affects your body’s ability to produce hemoglobin and healthy red blood cells.
Common blood cancers
There are many different blood cancer types. According to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the three most common blood cancers are:
Leukemia: Leukemia is the most common blood cancer in the United States and the most common cancer among children and teenagers. The five-year survival rate has quadrupled over the past 40 years.
Lymphoma: Lymphoma is cancer of your lymphatic system. The lymphoma survival rate has doubled over the past 40 years.
Myeloma: Myeloma is cancer that starts in your bone marrow and affects your plasma cells. More than half of people diagnosed with myeloma are alive five years after diagnosis.
Blood disorders can cause various symptoms in almost any area of the body. Most commonly, symptoms are caused by decreases in the blood components.
Decreased red blood cells and hemoglobin can cause symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
Decreased white blood cells or immune system proteins can cause recurrent fever and infections.
Decreased platelets or blood clotting factors can cause abnormal bleeding and bruising.
Occasionally, symptoms may relate to increases in blood components.
Increased red blood cells (erythrocytosis) can cause thickening of the blood (increased blood viscosity) and thereby cause headache and a red complexion (plethora).
Increased immune system proteins also can cause thickening of the blood (increased blood viscosity).
Increased platelets (thrombocythemia) or blood clotting factors can cause inappropriate excessive blood clotting (thrombosis).
When blood disorders cause a person's blood to become thickened, the thickened (more viscous) blood may have difficulty passing through small blood vessels, decreasing blood flow to certain areas of the body, which is a serious condition called hyperviscosity syndrome. Affected people may experience symptoms such as shortness of breath, headaches, dizziness, and confusion. Hyperviscosity syndrome can occur in people who have multiple myeloma, in which it is caused by increased immune system proteins.
Blood disorders often cause symptoms that can also occur in other disorders. For example, the weakness and shortness of breath caused by anemia can be caused by other conditions that impair oxygen delivery to the body, such as heart or lung disorders. Also, easy bruising, a symptom suggestive of a blood disorder, can be caused by other conditions such as disorders of the blood vessels or the use of various drugs such as aspirin. Blood in the urine or stool can be caused by a blood disorder but is usually caused by an abnormality in the urinary or gastrointestinal tract.
Although people may have bleeding after an injury or a medical procedure (such as dental procedures) or during menstruation, the presence of some blood disorders makes such bleeding worse. 
Some symptoms are more suggestive of a blood disorder. Just a few examples include the following:
Blood clot (phlebitis), usually in a leg (most often causing swelling, redness, and/or warmth of the leg or shortness of breath)
Petechiae (a fine pin-point red skin rash) caused by too few platelets
Blood blisters in the mouth (caused by too few platelets or clotting problems)
Swollen lymph nodes caused by white blood cell cancers (such as leukemias or lymphomas)
Pallor (pale skin) caused by anemia
Pica (eating of ice, dirt, or clay) suggests iron deficiency anemia
Leukemia and lymphoma
Leukemia is a form of blood cancer where too many white blood cells are produced and they do not work correctly. They start to crowd out red blood cells and platelets, which are responsible for transporting blood and clotting blood, respectively.
Common symptoms include swollen lymph nodes, sudden weight loss, easy bruising, fatigue, discomfort in the spleen (underneath the left lower ribs), visual problems and ear ringing. Visit a hematologist as soon as you can if you experience these symptoms.
Lymphoma is similar to leukemia in that it affects the white blood cells. However, the origin is different, as is the treatment. Lymphoma is a cancer that starts in the lymphocytes, which are cells primarily devoted to fighting infection. If you have been feeling symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, coughing and swollen lymph nodes, it may be time to make an appointment.
A hematologist can help diagnose lymphoma and aid in treatments.
2. Sickle cell disease
Warning signs of sickle cell disease have much in common with anemia, including jaundice and fatigue. Sometimes there is also swelling in the extremities, usually the feet and hands. The disease is a genetic disorder, one that is most common in those of African and Hispanic ancestry.
If someone in the family has sickle cell disease and you experience any of these symptoms, it may be smart to visit the hematologist as soon as possible.
3. Hemophilia
Hemophilia is usually caused by a platelet deficiency that either slows or stops the blood from clotting all together. Common symptoms include bleeding from the gums, nosebleeds that seem to last a long time, joint swelling and any prolonged bleeding from small cuts or injuries.
A hematologist will suggest how to treat hemophilia, but there are hormones and clotting medications that can make the condition manageable.
4. Deep vein thrombosis
Essentially the opposite of hemophilia, deep vein thrombosis is a condition that occurs when a blood cot will not go away. Blood clots can sometimes form in the leg veins or elsewhere and end up stuck in the legs. Deep vein thrombosis is painful, but it can also cause damage over time, as areas are deprived of oxygen.
These blood clots can also detach and do serious damage when entering places like the lung or the heart. Common signs include unusual warmth, pain or red skin in the affected area. A hematologist will generally use compression stockings and blood thinners to help alleviate the situation."
6,Infectious Disease,"Not everyone who has an infectious disease needs an infectious disease specialist. Your general internist or Primary Care Physician can take care of most infections, but sometimes specialized expertise is needed to either diagnose or manage specific infectious diseases.

When a fever raises the suspicion that you may have an infection, when an infection is potentially serious, or when problems occur with treatment, it may be necessary to consult an infectious diseases specialist. ID specialists can provide special insight into tests that will be helpful in diagnosing and understanding the infection and preventing recurrent infections. They can often help determine what treatment you need, if any, and whether you should receive antibiotics. You may not require any treatment, but if you do, they may confer with your personal physician about which diagnostic testing and forms of treatment are best suited to your needs.

If you are hospitalized for an infection or acquire an infection while hospitalized, ID specialists will follow and help direct your hospital care. In some cases, they may continue to see you after you go home from the hospital."
7,Cardiology,"What Does a Cardiologist Do?
Your cardiologist, or heart doctor, helps prevent heart disease through screenings and checkups. They treat symptoms of heart conditions or heart diseases. These diseases can include:
heart attacks, when blood flow to your heart is blocked;
heart disease (or coronary artery disease), when blood vessels that bring nutrients to your heart are blocked;
heart failure, when your heart can’t pump blood properly;
heart rhythms (or arrythmias), when your heart beats too fast, too slow, or irregularly; and
valve problems, when your heart doesn’t open or close properly.
10 Reasons You May Want to See a Cardiologist
Most patients think about seeing a doctor when they don’t feel well. But they may put it off or wait for an annual physical with their family care doctor to ask questions about any physical pains or symptoms. How severe should the symptoms be before you see a heart specialist or cardiologist?
1. Physician Recommendation
If your family-care doctor recommends you see a cardiologist, do it. Don’t put it off. You’ll regret it.
2. Heart Pain
Many of us are familiar with the symptoms of heart disease such as heart attack or stroke. Other symptoms of heart disease include:
Severe pressure, squeezing, pain, or discomfort in the chest.
Pain or discomfort that spreads into the shoulders, neck, arms, or jaw.
Chest pain that becomes more intense.
If you have any doubts about whether or not you are experiencing a symptom, get checked out.
3. Family History
If anyone in your family has or has had heart problems, you should be aware of heart disease symptoms and consider talking to a cardiologist about them.
4. High Total Cholesterol
The body needs cholesterol to make hormones, convert sunlight into vitamin D, and produce bile acids to digest fat. However, the higher your total cholesterol, the greater your risk for heart disease (a cholesterol level of 200 mg/dL or higher).
5. High Blood Pressure
Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to several health issues such as heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. People with high blood pressure typically don’t have any symptoms, so it’s important to have yours checked regularly. Learn how to monitor your blood pressure.
6. History of Smoking
Smoking is a huge risk factor for heart disease. It lowers the flow of oxygen to the heart and increases blood pressure, heart rate, and blood clotting as well as damages the cells lining the arteries.
7. Diabetic
Unfortunately diabetes can contribute to heart disease. If you experience symptoms of heart problems and are diabetic, you should see a cardiologist.
8. Difficult Pregnancy, Preeclampsia
Preeclampsia is often a hidden risk factor for heart disease. The two times a woman is most likely to develop heart disease is during pregnancy or post-menopause.
9. Starting a New Exercise Program
You are over the age of 40 and starting a new exercise program. You may already be working with a doctor on being more active, but a cardiologist can check your heart health and recommend exercises that would be good for your heart.
10. Gum Disease
Believe it or not, gum disease can happen when the body is inflamed. Patients with swollen gums often have heart disease.
Cardiologists often see people when they’re having chest discomfort or chest pain. “People experience this differently,” says Dr. Reed. “These symptoms often feel like indigestion, so they might write them off. Having chest pain or discomfort is a very serious symptom that patients should not ignore. They should seek medical attention, whether it be through a primary care physician to start, or a cardiologist.” 
You should see a cardiologist if you’re experiencing these symptoms: 
A feeling like your heart is racing very fast (often called heart palpitations). 
Feeling like you might faint. 
Shortness of breath that’s worsening. 
Chest discomfort or bad indigestion that’s not going away. 
Swelling in the legs. 
Noticeable weight gain.
These can also be common signs of heart failure and heart disease, Dr. Reed says, which is why it’s important to see a cardiologist or primary care physician.
Feeling of fullness in the stomach with a loss of appetite or nausea
Extreme fatigue or less able to complete daily activities
Respiratory infection or cough that gets worse
Fast heart rate (above 100 beats per minute)
New, irregular heartbeat
Chest pain or discomfort during activity that goes away with rest
Trouble breathing during regular activities or at rest
Changes in sleep patterns, such as trouble sleeping or feels the need to sleep a lot more than usual
Urinates less than usual
Gets restless or confused
Constant dizziness or lightheadedness
Nausea or poor appetite
New chest pain or discomfort that is severe and unexpected. It can happen with or without shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or weakness.
Fast heart rate (more than 150 beats per minute), especially if they are short of breath, too
Shortness of breath that doesn't go away when they rest
Sudden weakness or can't move their arms or legs
Sudden, severe headache
Faints and loses consciousness
Chest discomfort
Shortness of breath
Swelling in your legs
High blood pressure
Abnormally fast or slow heart rate
Dizziness or fainting
Strong family history of premature heart disease or cardiac death
Leg pain or ulcers resulting from blood vessel diseases"
8,Psychiatry,"A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who’s an expert in the field of psychiatry — the branch of medicine focused on the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental, emotional and behavioral disorders.
Psychiatrists can diagnose and treat several conditions, including:
Alcohol use disorder and other substance use disorders.
Alzheimer’s disease.
Anxiety disorders.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Autism spectrum disorder.
Bipolar disorder.
Body dysmorphic disorder.
Depression.
Dissociative disorders.
Eating disorders.
Gambling disorder.
Gender dysphoria.
Hoarding disorder.
Mood disorders.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Panic disorder.
Personality disorders.
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Postpartum depression.
Schizoaffective disorder.
Schizophrenia.
Sleep disorders.
What treatments do psychiatrists use?
Psychiatrists use and prescribe a variety of treatments, including:
Psychotherapy (talk therapy).
Medications.
Other treatments, such as electric convulsive treatment (ECT) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
Treatment for mental health conditions is very individualized and unique to each person. Treatment often involves a combination of therapies.
Psychotherapy
Psychotherapy, often called “talk therapy” or “therapy” for short, is a treatment that involves talking with a trained mental healthcare professional to help identify and work through the factors that are affecting your mental health or may be triggering your mental health condition.
The goal of psychotherapy is to eliminate or control disabling or troubling thought and behavioral patterns so you can function better. Psychotherapy can be short-term or long-term depending on your symptoms and condition.
There are several different types of psychotherapy, including:
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
Interpersonal therapy (IPT).
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT).
Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT).
Problem-solving therapy (PST).
Psychodynamic therapy.
While it can be difficult and overwhelming to seek help for mental health conditions, it’s essential to do so. Mental health conditions are very common, and your mental health is just as important as your physical health.
In some cases, your primary healthcare provider may refer you to a psychiatrist if you share your symptoms with them. But you can usually go directly to a psychiatrist for a diagnosis and treatment plan if you prefer.
Mental health episodes may happen randomly, infrequently or be constant. The important thing to remember is that if they’re negatively affecting your quality of life, it’s a clear sign you need to seek help.
If you have any of the following symptoms or experiences, you may want to consider seeing a psychiatrist or telling your primary healthcare provider:
Inability to manage or control your emotions.
Continuous or frequent episodes of anger or rage.
Excessive or irrational fears.
Engaging in risky behavior.
Excessive worrying and/or sadness.
Significant changes in sleep patterns.
Substance use.
Eating disorders.
Declining performance in school or work.
Withdrawal from social situations.
Thoughts of self-harm.
Remember, there’s no shame in having or seeking help for a mental health condition. The sooner you seek help and treatment, the sooner you’ll feel better.
1. Inability to Control Emotions
At one time or another, everyone can experience a negative emotion, such as sadness of anger. In the case, where you are not experiencing a mental health condition, you are normally in charge of your emotions, thus not impaired by them. 
However, if your emotions are so excessive that you are unable to control them, it is an indication that you may need to seek the assistance of a psychiatrist or a psychologist. 
Typical symptoms include the following:
Feeling overcome with anger or sadness on regular basis
Assuming the worst possible scenario if a situation becomes somewhat challenging
Avoiding normal events in life, as they may trigger high levels of anxiety
2. Changes in Sleeping Patterns
Your sleep pattern tells a lot about your mental health. If you are experiencing mental health conditions, you tend to have poor sleep patterns. Unfortunately, poor sleep patterns make it difficult to cope with mental illness symptoms, thus creating a negative feedback loop.
Typical changes in sleep patterns could include the following:
Having troubles falling sleep 
Waking up too early 
Waking up several times during the night
3. Substance Abuse
One the harmful coping mechanism with mental health challenges is turning to drugs and alcohol. Another example of such coping mechanism is turning to food. 
Red flags could include the following:
Changes in your usual amount of alcohol consumption
Thinking about or turning to drugs
Over-eating or not wanting to eat
4. Changes in Performance at School or Work 
When your performance at work or at school is adversely affected, it is one of the signs that shows you are struggling with emotional or psychological issues. 
Typical warning signs include the following:
Feeling disconnected from aspects of your job that used to make you happy
Receiving negative feedback from your managers 
Missing deadlines 
5. Your Friends Show Concerns About You
Sometimes, others, like your friends, can see patterns that are difficult to see from your perspective. It is therefore worthwhile to listen to their views. 
The questions and comments that should raise the red flag include the following:
Are you doing okay? I am concerned about you!
You keep forgetting our arrangement every time. 
Are you talking with anyone about this?
6. Worthlessness
We all have negative thoughts about ourselves from time to time. However, if negative thoughts are persistent, you are consistently criticising yourself, it could be suggestive of a mental health disorder, such depression. Such situations should not be taken lightly, as it could lead to thoughts of harming yourself. It is best to seek emergency mental health intervention as soon as possible. 
Typical negative thoughts that my plague the mind include the following:
“I am no good”
“I fail at everything, I try” (Catastrophising) 
“I can never be loved”
Common anxiety signs and symptoms include:
Feeling nervous, restless or tense
Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom
Having an increased heart rate
Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation)
Sweating
Trembling
Feeling weak or tired
Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry
Having trouble sleeping
Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems
Having difficulty controlling worry
Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety
Several types of anxiety disorders exist:
Agoraphobia (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often avoid places or situations that might cause you to panic and make you feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed.
Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem.
Generalized anxiety disorder includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events — even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression.
Panic disorder involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred.
Selective mutism is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning.
Separation anxiety disorder is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles.
Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others.
Specific phobias are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people.
Substance-induced anxiety disorder is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs.
Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive.
When to see a doctor
See your doctor if:
You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life
Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control
You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety
You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem
You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors — if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately
Depression is a complex medical condition. It can affect every aspect of a person’s life, from their personal relationships to their physical health. And of course, it impacts mental wellbeing.
But being unhappy isn’t the same as being depressed. Depression is a term often used loosely to describe how people feel after a bad week at work or when they’re going through a breakup. Clinical depression, also known as major depressive disorder, is more than feeling blue. Specific symptoms differentiate depression from the type of generalized sadness all people sometimes experience.
1. Hopeless outlook
People who are depressed often experience feelings of hopelessness, though this is not the same across all races and ethnicities.
 and Latino individuals are the most likely to report feeling hopeless “all or most of the time,” followed by people of two or more races, according to a recent National Health Interview Survey.
Sometimes people who are depressed feel like they are worthless, a sentiment that the survey found most common among people of two or more races, as well as and.
Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are most likely to feel like “everything is an effort, all the time,” followed by individuals.
Some people who live with depression also experience inappropriate guilt. They may often think, “It’s all my fault,” or “What’s the point?”
Loneliness and isolation are among the top three reasons people describe themselves as having poor mental health, as reported by more than 1 million people who screened themselves for depression and anxiety on Mental Health America’s website in 2020. For /Latinx people, it was cited as the biggest cause of mental health issues.
2. Loss of interest
Depression can take the pleasure or enjoyment out of the things people love. A loss of interest in or withdrawal from activities that were previously looked forward to — sports, hobbies, going out with friends — is frequently a sign of major depression. In 2020, a whopping 90% of people who identified with more than one race reported symptoms of depression to Mental Health America.
Another studyTrusted Source of 25,503 older Americans found that Black and  individuals were 1.5 to 2 times more likely than white people to experience sadness and a loss of interest in everyday life.
Losing interest in sex is common. Symptoms of major depression include a decreased sex drive and even impotence.
3. Increased fatigue and sleep problems
Part of the reason that people living with depression might stop doing things they enjoy is because they feel very tired. Depression often comes with a lack of energy and an overwhelming feeling of fatigue, which can be among its most debilitating symptoms. This can lead to excessive sleeping.
Asian and Pacific Islander people (particularly those from older age groups) may report feeling tired or sleepy rather than depressed, as the latter can be seen as less culturally acceptable. Because these symptoms can be attributed to other conditions, including chronic fatigue syndrome, healthcare professionals may miss the true cause.
Depression is also linked to insomnia, and they can feed off each other. A lack of restful sleep may lead to anxiety.
4. Anxiety
Depression and anxiety often occur together. Symptoms of anxiety can include:
nervousness, restlessness, or a sense of tension
feelings of danger, panic, or dread
rapid heart rate
rapid breathing
increased or heavy sweating
trembling or muscle twitching
trouble focusing or thinking clearly about anything other than one central preoccupation
5. Irritability (in men)
Depression can affect the sexes differently. Research shows that men with depression may also experience irritability, escapist or risky behavior, substance abuse, or misplaced anger.
Overall, men are less likelyTrusted Source than women to recognize depression or seek treatment for that condition. They are more likely to get help when their symptoms resemble “traditional” depression but may not identify their irritability or other strong feelings as something requiring treatment, according to a 2018 studyTrusted Source.
Women are about twice as likelyTrusted Source to take antidepressant medication as men, with the most frequent users being those over 60, according to the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. White people are also far more likely to take antidepressants than Black, , or Asian individuals.
Men, for their part, prefer medicine to talk therapy when they get treatment, a 2020 studyTrusted Sourcefound. 
6. Changes in appetite and weight
Weight and appetite can fluctuate for people with depression. This experience may be different for each person. Some people will have an increased appetite and gain weight, while others won’t be hungry and will lose weight.
One indication of whether dietary changes are related to depression is if they’re intentional or not. If they’re not, it may mean that they’re caused by depression.
7. Uncontrollable emotions
One moment it’s an outburst of anger. The next, tears are flowing uncontrollably. Depression can cause mood swings that fluctuate wildly, and it has nothing to do with anything outside of the person experiencing them.
8. Looking at death
Depression is sometimes connected to suicide. In 2020, nearly 46,000 people died from suicide in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTrusted Source (CDC). Black people are less likely to die by suicide than white people, but Black teenagers are more likely to attempt suicide than white teenagers.
Statisticians were surprisedTrusted Source to note a significant decrease in the number of people who died by suicide in 2019 and 2020, after years of increases. In 2020 alone, the number of white females who died by suicide dropped 10%, while the number of white males doing so decreased 3%. The number of Asian men dying by suicide also dropped in 2020.
At the same time, some groups saw increases. In 2020, the number of  men dying by suicide rose 5%, while the number of Black and American Indian men dying this way also rose.
According to the CDC, American Indian and Native American people are far more likely to die by suicide than any other group, followed by white people.
In Mental Health America’s online screenings, 46% of American Indians and Native Americans reported thinking about suicide or self-harm in 2020, and the number of those having such thoughts increased 7.5% over 2019. This reflected the largest jump in suicidal ideation from any racial or ethnic group surveyed.
Those who die by suicide usually show symptoms of depression or mental health issues first. Often people will talk about it or make a first attempt before succeeding in ending their lives. When people are at immediate risk of self-harm or hurting others, those around them should:
Call 911 or a local emergency number.
Stay with the person until help arrives.
Remove any guns, knives, medications, or other potentially dangerous items.
Listen, but don’t judge, argue, threaten, or yell

9,Dermatology," Scars, Acne, Moles?
As your body’s first line of defense, your skin takes a lot of hits. Not only is it the largest organ in your body, but your skin also protects you from germs; repels water; and covers your blood vessels, nerves, and organs. If you aren’t feeling good about the skin you’re in or are worried about something on your skin, you should consider seeing a dermatologist.
1. A mole or patch of skin that's changed
If a mole or patch of your skin has changed in color, size, shape, or symptom you better see a dermatologist. Such changes like those are often signs of skin cancer, and when it comes to cancer you want treatment sooner rather than later. Your dermatologist can also help you learn how to do regular skin checkups or screenings.
2. Stubborn acne
You’ve tried over-the-counter products, fad diets, and cleanses, but your acne is still front and center. There is no shame is seeing a dermatologist to help you deal with this skin condition. Get some recommendations on how to put your best face forward.
3. Itchy hives or rashes that won’t go away
Are you having an allergic reaction? Do you have an infection in your skin? See a dermatologist and get some answers. They may prescribe medications or recommend another form of treatment to smooth things over.
4. Scars from acne, blemishes, or cuts and scrapes
If your scar is looking less than desirable, a dermatologist could help you. Medical techniques like laser treatment therapy, microdermabrasion, and others can reduce scarring. With the treatment options available today, there is no need to feel self-conscious.

5. Persistent skin irritation
You have itchy, red, flaky skin and over-the-counter creams and lotions just aren’t working. You may think that the cause of your dry skin is the weather, sensitivity to skincare products, or even genetics. But in reality, you could have a chronic skin condition.
6. Nail disorders, ingrown nails, fungus, or others
Whether you are getting treatment for an ingrown nail, a fungal infection, wart, or something else, having a dermatologist look over your nails is a good thing. Nails can show signs of other body disorders like liver disease, heart conditions, anemia, or diabetes.
7. Hair loss
Noticed more hair than usual on your pillow in the morning? You may have a scalp disorder or want to start some preventive therapies before your hair loss makes a bigger impact on your life. Your dermatologist can recommend laser therapies or other treatments to keep you looking your best.
Feel Good About the Skin You’re In
Whether you are struggling with stubborn acne, have some itchy patches, or want treatment for another skin condition, think about seeing a dermatologist. They can help you decide the best steps for you to feel good about the skin you’re in.
Sign #1: You have a new spot on your skin, a spot that looks different than all of your others or a mole that has changed size, shape or color.
Skin cancer — the most common form of cancer in the U.S. — is the result of the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells. When skin cells suffer DNA damage, they can mutate and multiply quickly to form cancerous (malignant) tumors.
Skin cancer is considered “low risk” when the affected cells stay clustered in a single group. It becomes “high risk” when these abnormal cells invade surrounding tissue.
The good news is that if skin cancer is detected early, before it spreads, chances of a complete recovery are very high.
There are many different types of skin cancer. Most are easy to detect with a skin examination and develop on the skin’s outer layer on areas that are exposed to the most sun. These areas include your face, head, hands, arms and legs. Types of skin cancer include:
Actinic Keratosis
These pre-cancerous lesions develop on sun-exposed areas and can be a warning sign that skin cancer is developing. Generally, the tumors stay contained and don’t spread to other areas.
Basal Cell Carcinoma
This type of cancer typically begins as a small, shiny bump on the face, though it can occur on any part of the body. If caught and treated early, basal cell carcinoma is rarely life threatening. If left untreated, however, it can spread to nearby bone or tissue.
Up to 30% of Caucasians may develop basal cell carcinomas during their lifetime.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This cancer develops in the squamous cells that make up the outer layer of skin, typically on areas that are most exposed to the sun. It can show up in many forms — a firm, red nodule; a flat sore with a scaly crust; or a new sore or raised area on an old scar or ulcer. Though rarely life threatening, squamous cell carcinomas can be aggressive and can spread to other parts of the body.
Melanoma
The deadliest form of skin cancer, melanoma can spread very quickly and become life threatening if not diagnosed early. Melanoma can start as a sore that doesn’t heal or as a mole with an irregular border. A mole with redness or swelling beyond its border, one with surface changes or a mole that has associated itchiness, tenderness or pain can also be signs of melanoma.
So, how do you determine if a mole or spot is skin cancer?
In most cases, moles and spots are harmless and come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Some moles, however, are not normal and need to be examined by a dermatologist.
Normal vs. Atypical Moles
“Normal” moles are usually smaller than a pencil eraser. They are round and symmetrical with an even color and smooth borders.
Most moles can be classified as flat moles, raised moles or skin tags. Flat moles are generally dark or irregular spots on your skin. Raised moles are deeper than flat moles and can appear in a wide range of colors. Skin tags are just painless growths on the skin — sometimes a shade darker than your primary skin tone.
All of these moles are harmless and do not need to be removed for medical reasons. On the other hand, atypical moles — also called dysplastic nevi — are unusual looking moles that look different than healthy, normal moles when viewed at the cellular level. They are typically asymmetric and very dark or multi-colored. They may have indistinct borders and are most commonly found on the back, chest, buttocks or scalp. Though atypical moles may look like melanoma, they are non-cancerous and won’t necessarily turn into skin cancer. However, if you have atypical moles, you may have a higher risk of developing skin cancer in the future.
Anytime you have a suspicious mole or spot on your skin that looks different than the others on your body — or you have a new mole after age 40 — you should have it checked by a dermatologist.
Look for the ABCDEs:
Asymmetrical – One half doesn’t mirror the other half.
Border that is ragged – The edges are ragged, irregular or notched.
Color that is non-uniform – The color is not consistent throughout. Look for different shades of tan, brown or black.
Imension larger than 6mm – The diameter is roughly ½ inch or larger.
Evolving appearance – There is a change in the color or an increase in size over time.
Most dysplastic moles will remain stable and don’t need to be removed, but they should still be watched closely at home and monitored for any changes. Your best bet is to screen your skin monthly on your own and see your dermatologist for skin exams every six to 12 months.
Remember to check every part of your skin — even between your toes and on the bottoms of your feet — on a regular basis. If you can’t see a particular part of your body, ask someone you trust to help check your skin. It’s also a good idea to take pictures of abnormal moles as a reference so that you can see if they have changed.
When in doubt, have your dermatologist evaluate any and all areas of concern.
You Need To Have A Mole Or Skin Cancer Removed.
If you have atypical moles or develop new moles after the age of 40, a dermatologist will most likely want to biopsy one or more of your moles.
If the biopsy shows that the mole is benign, your doctor will likely recommend that you continue to monitor it over time. Otherwise, your doctor may determine that it needs to be removed.
Cryotherapy, or cryosurgery, is a simple, non-invasive procedure that uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and destroy moles and other growths on the skin. By applying liquid nitrogen directly to skin lesions, dermatologists can target damaged skin cells and destroy them at the cellular level.
The procedure is simple, affordable and virtually painless. The affected area may blister and scab over, but should completely heal within three to six weeks.
You Have Severe Acne That Isn’t Responding To Over-The-Counter Medications.
Acne is more than just a cosmetic problem — it’s a serious dermatological condition caused by inflammation in pores that have been clogged with oil, dead skin cells or bacteria. When pores get clogged, the bacteria inside multiplies and causes your immune system to react with swelling and redness, forming a “pimple.”
Acne affects men and women of all ages and can be triggered by hormones, diet, stress and even some medications.
Mild forms of acne can sometimes be treated with over-the-counter products, but if you have stubborn, recurrent acne that is not clearing up after months of using these treatments, it’s time to find a dermatologist.
What Is Cystic Acne?
Cystic acne is a severe form of acne that occurs when oil and dead skin cells build up in pores and rupture. The inflammation extends deep into your skin, forming a tender red bump that is often filled with pus. If the cysts burst, the inflammation can spread and lead to more breakouts or even scarring.
Cystic acne won’t go away on its own and won’t respond to over-the-counter medications. You can’t take care of it by excessively scrubbing your skin or squeezing blemishes. In fact, these methods can cause the infection to deepen and ultimately make the situation worse.
Cystic acne needs to be treated by a board-certified dermatologist.
You Have Persistent Itching Or A Rash That Won’t Go Away.
There are several skin conditions that can cause uncomfortable inflammation, itching and flaking skin that just won’t clear up on their own. If you have a rash or persistent irritation and itching, it might be time to ask your doctor for help.
Eczema
Also called dermatitis, eczema is a common condition with symptoms that can range from mild itching and redness to severe scaling and cracking of the skin. Causes can include genetics, age, allergies or an overactive immune system.
Psoriasis
Psoriasis — a chronic autoimmune inflammatory condition — causes patches of skin to become inflamed, red and bumpy. This occurs when the immune system mistakes skin cells for a virus or other infection and responds by producing more skin growth.
Rosacea
A fairly common skin condition, rosacea causes redness in the face and sometimes small, red pus-filled bumps or swollen blood vessels on the nose and cheeks. Symptoms can last for weeks or months at a time and can sometimes be mistaken for acne or other skin conditions.
In most cases, your dermatologist can prescribe oral or topical medications — and even some laser therapies — to help ease the symptoms of these skin conditions.
Your Appearance Is Damaging Your Confidence Or Negatively Impacting Your Quality Of Life.
There are many symptoms and medical conditions that require a dermatologist’s immediate attention, but your doctor can also help with a number of cosmetic concerns.
In addition to medically treating skin conditions, dermatologists provide a wide range of minimally invasive, low-impact cosmetic treatments to restore your skin’s youthful appearance and help you regain your self-esteem and confidence.
As we age, our appearance changes in many ways that can affect our overall wellbeing. Skin loses its elasticity and collagen. Wrinkles appear on the face after years of repetitive expressions. Hair begins to thin and fall out where we want it and grow where we don’t want it. These changes can cause emotional distress and can even lead to depression.
Cosmetic surgery and non-surgical treatments are designed to help you look and feel your best, and most are conducted in your dermatologist’s office with little or no downtime.
Injections and Dermal Fillers
Sometimes called injectable wrinkle fillers, dermal and soft tissue fillers are an affordable way to smooth out the surface of your face. Most procedures can be quickly performed in your dermatologist’s office, and results last for several months.
These treatments include Botox, which works by relaxing the muscle under the wrinkle, as well as injectable dermal and soft tissue fillers that fill creases in the skin with another substance to restore volume.
Fillers can be hyaluronic, synthetic, collagen or even autologous, which means fat from your own body is surgically removed, treated and injected.
Skin Resurfacing and Rejuvenation
In addition to facials and chemical peels, dermatologists offer a number of other treatments to exfoliate, even out the skin’s surface and improve the overall appearance of your skin.
These procedures include CO2 laser restoration, dermaplaning, IPL photo rejuvenation, laser skin resurfacing, laser vein elimination, microdermabrasion, microneedling, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, skin lightening, tattoo removal and more.
Many of these state-of-the-art, minimally invasive treatments use laser technology and are performed in the comfort of your dermatologist’s office.

10,Gastroenterology,"If you have unexplained or frequent digestive issues, such as abdominal discomfort or changes to your bowel habits, someone's probably told you to see a gastroenterologist, also sometimes referred to as a GI doctor.
But if you've never seen a gastroenterologist before, you may be unsure whether your digestive symptoms really warrant seeing a specialist. You might even be wondering: What is a gastroenterologist?
Dr. Kerri Glassner, a gastroenterologist at Houston Methodist, explains everything you need to know if you're deciding whether it's time to see one, including what to expect at your first appointment.
What does a gastroenterologist do?
A gastroenterologist is a specialist with expertise in the disorders and diseases that affect the digestive system — which includes the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus) as well as the pancreas, liver, bile ducts and gallbladder.
The digestive disorders and issues that a gastroenterologist treats include:
Unexplained changes in bowel habits, including diarrhea, constipation and blood in the stool
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
Heartburn
Hemorrhoids
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
Pancreatitis
Ulcers
""Gastroenterologists are trained to perform a number of procedures used to help diagnose and treat these conditions, such as upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, biopsy and the various endoscopic techniques needed to visualize the digestive system, including endoscopic ultrasound,"" explains Dr. Glassner.
When should you see a gastroenterologist?
Here are seven reasons to consider seeing a gastroenterologist:
1. Ongoing diarrhea
From food to infection to certain medications, many things can bring on a bout of diarrhea. However, if your stool is regularly more liquid than solid, it's time to check in with a GI doctor.
""Chronic diarrhea can be an indication of a few different digestive disorders, including IBS, IBD or small bacterial overgrowth (SIBO),"" says Dr. Glassner. ""IBS is the most common cause of chronic diarrhea. Fortunately, there are many treatment avenues your doctor can use to help manage your symptoms.""
2. Constipation
The frequency of bowel movements ultimately varies from person to person, but Dr. Glassner says that less than three a week is typically considered constipation. You might also be constipated if your bowel movements are very small, very hard or difficult to pass.
If you're constipated more weeks than not, consult a gastroenterologist.
""Constipation can have many causes and it can be hard to manage on your own at home,"" says Dr. Glassner. ""A GI specialist can help determine the likely cause of your constipation and recommend the lifestyle changes and medications that can help make your bowel movements more regular.""
3. Frequent or severe heartburn
Getting heartburn now and then shouldn't be a matter of huge concern, and the good news is that occasional heartburn can typically be managed yourself at home.
But if you're having heartburn symptoms more than a couple of times per week, it could be a sign of GERD — a condition that, over time, can damage and scar the lining of the esophagus.
""Chronic acid reflux doesn't go away on its own, so it's important to be evaluated by a specialist,"" says Dr. Glassner. ""Left untreated, GERD can cause permanent damage to the esophagus. This damage can lead to issues swallowing, cause painful ulcers and even increase a person's risk of developing esophageal cancer.""
4. Feeling unusually bloated
Bloating, which can feel like your belly is full or tight, is often caused by issues that result in excess gas production, hypersensitivty to gas or gas being trapped in your colon.
""Constipation can cause bloating since the longer waste stays in your colon, the more likely it is to be fermented by resident bacteria, which creates gas,"" explains Dr. Glassner. ""But bloating can also be a sign of IBS, a food sensitivity such as lactose intolerance, SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth) or gastroparesis (partial paralysis of the stomach).""

5. Sudden or severe abdominal pain
We've all dealt with bellyaches, but severe abdominal pain that lasts for hours or abdominal pain that comes on suddenly and intensely isn't normal.
""A stomach ulcer or peptic ulcer, which is a sore on the lining of your stomach or first part of your small intestine can lead to burning abdominal pain, particularly after eating,"" says Dr. Glassner. ""An untreated ulcer can cause swelling and scarring that blocks your digestive tract.""
Consistently severe abdominal pain can also be a sign of gallstones, pancreatitis or liver disease. A gastroenterologist can help determine the cause of your pain.
6. Rectal bleeding or blood in your stool
If you see blood on your toilet paper or as you flush the toilet, it could be hemorrhoids — a fairly common issue that can typically be managed with at-home remedies or over-the-counter products.
""However, if hemorrhoids aren't responding to these treatments or you're getting them frequently, a gastroenterologist can recommend more advanced treatments that can be help you get relief,"" Dr. Glassner adds.
Additionally, don't assume that blood in the toilet can only mean hemorrhoids.
""Any time you see blood in your stool or have rectal bleeding that is accompanied by changes in your bowel habits or to the color or consistency of your stool, it's critical that you see a gastroenterologist,"" warns Dr. Glassner. ""Rectal bleeding isn't always a huge concern, but it can be a sign of a serious medical condition such as colorectal cancer.""
7. You're due for a colonoscopy
If you're over the age of 45 or have a strong family history of colorectal cancer, you've probably heard your doctor recommend a colonoscopy.
""Most people begin having screening colonoscopies at age 45,"" says Dr. Glassner. ""From there, the frequency varies based on your results — but if the findings are normal and you have no other risk factors, you only need to repeat a colonoscopy every 10 years.""
And while a colonoscopy might sound uncomfortable, it can save your life. Early detection of colorectal cancer is important — when caught early, it can lead to less aggressive treatment and better chance of survival.
What happens at a gastroenterology appointment?
If you've noticed any of those seven signs, it's time to consider scheduling an appointment with GI doctor.
At your first appointment, your gastroenterologist will:
Ask you about your digestive symptoms and medical history
Recommend any lifestyle changes or medications that can help relieve your symptoms
Discuss any tests, screenings or procedures that may be needed
You may find it helpful to make a list of your symptoms before your appointment so that you don't forget to ask about any of the issues you're having.
""Through this initial evaluation, your doctor will start the process of uncovering the cause of your digestive issues and begin addressing your symptoms,"" Dr. Glassner explains. ""If your condition is chronic, he or she will also discuss how best to manage your condition over time. Your doctor may also talk to you about additional testing that may be needed if your symptoms don't improve.""
When Should I See a GI Doctor?
It is in the interest of your health to see a gastroenterologist if you have been experiencing one or more of the following:
You have relatively frequent (or occasionally severe) indigestion, heartburn, or abdominal pain, and over-the-counter medication does not do enough to make you feel better.
You are chronically constipated. Having bowel movements fewer than three times a week is generally defined as chronic constipation. Proper elimination is vitally important to your overall health, because your body needs to remove the waste and not retain it. If stools are hard to pass and irregular, your GI doctor can help you get your elimination back into balance.
You have difficulty swallowing, or you experience pain when swallowing. Heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and esophageal cancer can all cause difficulty swallowing, and a skilled gastroenterologist can determine the cause and provide a solution that works.
You experience unexplained nausea or vomiting. Ulcers or gastritis can have this effect, especially after eating. Vomiting is especially harmful to the esophagus, because the powerful and highly acidic digestive juices flowing upwards from the stomach can damage the delicate lining of the esophagus and throat.
You are losing weight without trying to lose weight (unintentional weight loss). This is a common symptom of gastrointestinal problems. Peptic ulcers and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can cause unexplained weight loss, and it can be treated by your gastroenterologist.
Your stools are black and tarry or have red streaks. This can be a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding or it could be due to hemorrhoids, which are enlarged veins around or inside the anus. Because it might warrant special treatment, these symptoms should be evaluated by a trusted gastroenterologist.
You vomit blood, also called hematemesis. Gastritis, ulcers, pancreatitis, and cancer – such as esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and pancreatic cancer – can cause you to vomit blood.
You have symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue, weakness, dizziness, feeling cold, and shortness of breath. Many gastrointestinal problems can cause malabsorption of iron and thereby low iron levels, which is iron-deficiency anemia. GI conditions that can lead to anemia include celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and H. pylori infection.
What symptoms should I tell my gastroenterologist about?
You might come to a gastroenterologist with common gastrointestinal symptoms, such as:
Abdominal pain.
Bloated stomach.
Indigestion.
Gas and gas pain.
Nausea and vomiting.
Rectal bleeding.
Diarrhea.
Constipation or difficulty pooping.
Unexplained weight loss or weight gain.
Heartburn.
Jaundice.
A gastroenterologist may begin by physically examining you. They may feel and listen to your abdominal organs from the outside, or insert a finger into your rectum. They may order follow-up tests, such as blood tests, poop tests or imaging tests like GI X-ray exams that take pictures of your organs from the outside. But when they need more information than these tests can provide, gastroenterologists are specially trained to perform endoscopic procedures. These are exams that look inside your body with an endoscope — a tiny video camera on the end of a long, thin, flexible tube they insert into your body.
Endoscopic procedures include:
Upper endoscopy or EGD: an examination of your upper GI tract, from your throat down through your stomach to your upper small intestine (duodenum).
Enteroscopy: examination of your small intestine.
Colonoscopy: an examination of your lower GI tract or large intestine.
Endoscopic ultrasound: an upper or lower endoscopy with an ultrasound wand attached to the endoscope, which helps to visualize your biliary system.
ERCP: endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, an upper endoscopy that extends into your bile ducts and then takes fluoroscopic X-rays of your biliary system (video X-rays).
Polypectomy: removal of polyps from your stomach or intestines during endoscopy.
Endoscopy exams give gastroenterologists a more detailed view inside your body to see how things are working and what might be causing your symptoms. But that’s not all — gastroenterologists can also take tissue samples and perform minor interventions with tiny tools they pass through the endoscope. This makes endoscopy an intermediate step before surgery that gastroenterologists can take to treat your condition. And it’s often enough. Gastroenterologists can relieve blockages, open up narrowed channels, stop bleeding and remove tumors through the endoscope. They can also interpret the biopsy results.
Do gastroenterologists treat cancer?
A gastroenterologist is likely to be the first to discover if you have cancer in any of the organs of your digestive system. Through endoscopy and biopsy, gastroenterologists locate, remove and identify cancerous tumors throughout your GI tract and biliary system. If they do find cancer, they’ll likely conduct further endoscopic procedures to help stage it. That means they’ll take additional tissue samples to find out if the cancer has spread. In some cases, gastroenterologists can treat certain tumors through the endoscope, either by dissecting them or by targeting them with lasers.
Gastroenterologists may diagnose, stage or treat:
Stomach cancer.
Colorectal cancer.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
Duodenal cancer.
Small intestine cancer.
Esophageal cancer.
Liver cancer.
Pancreatic cancer.
Gallbladder cancer.
Bile duct cancer.
But you might have a gastroenterologist on your care team for other types of cancer too. Your team might need a gastroenterologist to use their endoscopic skills to help look for signs of cancer spreading beyond the original site. Your team may also want to consult a gastroenterologist regarding the potential side effects of cancer treatment. For example, chemotherapy and radiation therapy can cause mucositis or radiation enteritis, painful inflammation in your GI tract. Symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation and malnutrition are also common, and gastroenterologists can help."
11,Oncology," Signs and Symptoms of Cancer
Signs and symptoms are how the body lets you know you are hurt or sick. Signs can be seen and measured, such as a fever or bleeding. Symptoms are what you feel or notice. Most signs and symptoms of illness do not mean you have cancer.
If you have any signs and symptoms that do not go away or get worse, you should see a doctor to find out what may be causing them. Do not wait to feel pain before seeing your doctor. If cancer is not the cause, your doctor can help figure out what the cause is and treat it, if needed.
There are many kinds of cancers and some share symptoms:
General Changes
Bleeding or bruising, for no known reason
Cough or hoarseness that does not go away
Fatigue or extreme tiredness that doesn’t get better with rest
Fever or night sweats for no known reason
Swelling or lumps anywhere such as in the neck, underarm, stomach, and groin
Breast Changes
Lump or firm feeling in your breast or under your arm
Nipple changes or discharge
Skin that is itchy, red, scaly, dimpled, or puckered
Bladder Changes
Trouble urinating
Pain when urinating
Blood in the urine
Bowel Changes
Blood in the stools
Changes in bowel habits
Eating Problems
Pain after eating (heartburn or indigestion that doesn’t go away)
Trouble swallowing

Vision changes
Hearing changes
Drooping of the face
Skin Changes
A flesh-colored lump that bleeds or turns scaly
A new mole or a change in an existing mole
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)
Signs and symptoms caused by cancer will vary depending on what part of the body is affected.
Some general signs and symptoms associated with, but not specific to, cancer, include:
Fatigue
Lump or area of thickening that can be felt under the skin
Weight changes, including unintended loss or gain
Skin changes, such as yellowing, darkening or redness of the skin, sores that won't heal, or changes to existing moles
Changes in bowel or bladder habits
Persistent cough or trouble breathing
Difficulty swallowing
Hoarseness
Persistent indigestion or discomfort after eating
Persistent, unexplained muscle or joint pain
Persistent, unexplained fevers or night sweats
Unexplained bleeding or bruising
"
12,Orthopedics,"1. Shoulder Pain
Pain in shoulders that increases at night and gets worse with movement should be examined by an orthopedic doctor. These symptoms are often combined with tenderness around a joint and can be a sign of tendonitis. This condition, which occurs due to overuse or injury, can  display the same symptoms in the elbow, heel and wrist. Tendons join the muscles to the bones in the body. If they become injured, overworked or lose elasticity during aging, they can cause the tendon to swell and become inflamed.
2. Trouble Climbing Stairs
Over time, joints in the knees and hips naturally begin to deteriorate, but sometimes they become too painful to function. If you have trouble walking, climbing stairs or getting out of chairs, it may be time to consider joint replacement surgery. Chronic pain that lasts more than six months and affects your daily life is a sign that your joints may be damaged. Reasons for joint replacement include past injuries and years of constant use.
3. Tingling or Numb Hands
If you feel like you commonly drop things, or if you have had a tingling in your thumb, index or middle finger, it’s possible that you have carpal tunnel syndrome. The nerve that runs from your forearm to your wrist travels through a “tunnel” in your wrist and gives the sensation to your thumb and all of your fingers except your pinky. Carpal tunnel syndrome can be caused by several things including a previous wrist fracture or working with tools or machinery that vibrate or require repetitive flexing of the wrist. 
4. Pain from Repetitive Motions
Occupations that require movement in a repetitive motion often create stress injuries in the muscles, tendons and nerves. Machines that produce vibrations, constantly awkward positions and forceful exertions also can cause stress injuries. This condition can cause pain and uncomfortable feelings in your body, especially in the upper body.
5. Painful Joints
Persistent or chronic pain in your joints is a sign that something is wrong. The term “chronic” means the pain lasts three to six months, or never goes away. This pain can be associated with inflammation or swelling around the joints, but it can also be a sign that the bones of the joints are rubbing together. All of these symptoms can be a sign of arthritis.
Arthritis is more prevalent in women than in men, and the risk of developing arthritis increases with age. However, people as young as 20 can develop arthritis depending on their risk factors. Excess weight, previous joint injuries and repeated bending of individual joints due to an occupation or everyday task can also increase your chances of arthritis.
6. Twisted Ankles
Walking on uneven ground or stepping on an object can often cause you to roll or twist your ankle. Pain on the outside of the ankle, swelling and bruising are all typical signs of a twisted or sprained ankle. Sprains are common in people who are on the move during the day. Some people have a predisposition to spraining their ankles due to their posture or the way their feet are turned. Past ankle sprains are also a risk factor for injuring your ankle again. 
7. Swollen Wrist
If you have ever fallen and landed on your hand, the chances are your wrist became swollen and bruised. More than likely, you had a sprained wrist. A sprain is the stretching of the ligaments that connect your bones to each other. Pulling or possibly even tearing these ligaments causes pain and loss of mobility in your wrist.
8. Swollen Joints
Joints that are swollen, tender, warm or stiff can be a sign of bursitis. This condition is caused by an increase in activity level, overuse or excess weight. A bursa is a sac filled with fluid that protects the muscles, tendons and bones from rubbing against each other. Bursitis is the swelling of these sacs. It happens most often in the shoulders, knees, elbows, feet and hips. 
9. Worsening Injury
An injury from an accident, like a fall or major collision, takes time to heal, but if the pain and swelling aren’t going away on their own you might have a fracture. A fracture is a crack or break in a bone. They happen most often to the arms, hips, spine and legs. Children break their arms more than adults because they attempt to catch themselves when they fall. People most at risk for fractures are under the age of 20 or over the age of 65.
Signs of a fracture include swelling or bruising over an injury to a bone, pain that gets worse with movement or pressure, and a loss of function of the injured body part.
10. Weak, Stiff and Bruised Muscles
If you have had an injury and are now experiencing swelling, pain and a bluish discoloration around the injury, it’s possible you have a muscle contusion. These injuries happen when a muscle is hit with a blunt object, or your body is slammed into a hard object. The fibers of the muscle are crushed, but the skin is not broken. Sometimes, blood can pool under the skin creating a lump over the injury.
Shoulder and elbow pain are some of the most common aches and pains people experience. Since the shoulder and elbow joints are also some of the most frequently used in your body, pain and injuries in these joints can significantly impact your daily life. However, many people aren't sure what doctor to see for these types of pain or even when to see a doctor.
Orthopedic doctors are specialists who treat shoulder and elbow pain. An orthopedic specialist can examine your shoulder or elbow and order imaging studies like X-rays, MRIs, or ultrasounds. He or she will identify what kind of pain you are experiencing, as well as what treatments will help.
Shoulder and elbow pain can either be the result of a sudden fall or injury or come on slowly from wear and tear on the joints. The cause of the pain or injury will determine when you should see an orthopedic doctor and when home remedies for shoulder or elbow pain are appropriate.
If you have any of the following symptoms, schedule an appointment to see an orthopedic doctor as soon as possible.
Limited range of motion; for example, you cannot lift your arm above your head or cannot bend or straighten your elbow
Dull or achy pain when you move your elbow or shoulder
Pain when using your elbow or shoulder
Pain in the elbow or shoulder when you are at rest
Difficulty sleeping because of shoulder or elbow pain
Numbness or tingling in your arm or shoulder
Weakness that gets increasingly worse
Ongoing or worsening pain that develops over time 
For many injuries, early treatment and intervention will help avoid more extensive damage. It could also improve the trajectory for healing.
Sometimes, it can get confusing whether to get that appointment with your orthopedic or just wait it out. So, when deciding whether to make an appointment with an orthopedic doctor, take into account these warning signs:
1. Swollen Joint
In the soft tissues surrounding joints, swelling tends to happen when fluid builds up in the tissues. It can be caused by trauma, bacterial infections, or reactive or chronic arthritis. Osteoarthritis, gout, septic arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis are additional conditions that can result in swollen joints.
Rare causes include ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatic fever, and an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).
Joint swelling warrants an evaluation from orthopedics, particularly if it is accompanied by pain. It is also essential to see a doctor if you have a fever along with swollen joints.
2. Back Pain
Anyone can suffer from back pain. According to statistics, 80% of people, ranging from young to elderly, suffer from upper or lower back pain. Mild back pains can be caused by activities of daily living like standing up in the kitchen, lifting weights, and overdoing exercises in addition to prolonged sitting.
But let's say your back pain is persistent, chronic, and getting worse, causing you to lose control of your bowels or bladder and weaken the muscles in your legs. In that situation, it is crucial to seek medical attention from an orthopedic specialist to prevent further deterioration and life-threatening conditions.
3. Persistent Or Chronic Joint Pain
A joint pain that lasts a long time is a warning sign. Chronic refers to pain that lasts three to six months or never goes away. This pain may indicate swelling or inflammation around the joints, but it may also suggest that the bones in the joints are rubbing against one another. All of these signs and symptoms may indicate arthritis.
Women are more likely than men to have arthritis. As people get older, their chances of getting arthritis also rise. However, people as young as 20 can develop arthritis depending on their risk factors. Additional risk factors for arthritis include being overweight, having had joint injuries in the past, and repeatedly bending a joint while performing a daily task or at work.
Experiencing pain for a few days is one thing, but persistent pain for several weeks or months should make you strongly think about getting professional help.
4. Difficulty In Climbing Stairs
Many people suffering from knee-related problems find it challenging to ascend and descend stairs. Most often caused by arthritis, which results in cartilage degeneration that cushions the knee joints, difficulty going up and down stairs is a sign of damage to the knee joints.
Even mild arthritis and the loss of knee joints' protective cushioning can make climbing stairs extremely difficult. Therefore, if you experience even a little discomfort or pain while using the stairs, you should see an orthopedic doctor and take action before the discomfort worsens.
5. Neck Pain that Is Increasing In Severity
Prolonged computer and smartphone use that strains the neck muscles can cause neck pain. This kind of neck pain, due to over-exhaustion, can be treated at home with rest and mild painkillers.
But if your neck pain lasts for several days and is accompanied by numbness or weakness in your hands or arms, headache, or shoulder pain, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible.
Some of the most common causes of increased and persistent neck pain include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis (bone spurs), and herniated disks (causing nerve compression). Rarely, increasing pain in the neck can also be a sign of more serious illnesses like cancers and meningitis.
6. Twisted Or Sprained Ankle
When the ligaments supporting the ankle are ripped or damaged, the ankle becomes sprained. Even though ankle sprains are frequent injuries brought on by running, jogging, walking on uneven terrain, or stepping on an object, they are also prevalent when engaging in sports.
If proper treatment is not received, they can cause crippling pain and result in long-term conditions like post-traumatic arthritis.
Depending on the severity of the ligament tear, tenderness, ankle instability, and swelling in the ankle, orthopedic doctors can assist you in recovering and returning to normal activities within 6 to 12 weeks. To avoid recurrent sprains and ankle instability, non-steroidal medications, flexible footwear, and ankle supports are also suggested.
7. Stiff, Weak, and Bruised Muscles
You may have a muscle contusion if you recently sustained an injury and are now dealing with swelling, pain, and a bluish discoloration around the injury. These wounds develop when your body collides with a hard object or when a blunt object strikes a muscle. The skin is not broken, but the muscle fibers are shattered, and blood can occasionally collect under the skin, causing a lump to form over the wound.
You can prevent significant complications occasionally arising from deep muscle contusions by seeking immediate medical attention and adhering to your orthopedic doctor's recommendations for rehabilitation. Compartment syndrome and myositis ossificans are two of the more common side effects.
8. Fractures
A fracture can occur when bone cracks or breaks as a result of excessive pressure. In addition, blunt force trauma, degenerative bone diseases like osteoporosis, and repetitive motion injury (where a bone is continuously or repeatedly stressed) can all result in fractures.
Untreated fractures can lead to blood loss as bones are richly supplied by blood vessels. It can also stunt the growth of the bone in a child if the long bone breaks near the growth plate of a joint. Fractures can also lead to injuries to the surrounding structure or underlying organs and tissues.
9. Bone Pain
In contrast to muscle and joint pain, bone pain is a severe discomfort felt in one or more bones. Osteopenia (low bone mass), mineral deficiencies, osteoporosis (brittle bones), cancers, injuries, and diseases that impede the blood flow to bones and bone tissues can all be major contributors to bone pain.
Persistent pain even when at rest, reduced range of motion, hunched posture, exhaustion, gradual height loss, and unexplained weight loss are all warning signs of bone pain. Pregnancy can also cause bone pain, also known as pelvic-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP).
Rarely, osteomyelitis (infection of the bone and the marrow) and leukemia (blood cancer) are also linked to bone pain. Therefore, one should not ignore bone pain and seek medical attention as soon as possible.
10. Instability In Walking
Balancing and mobility issues can develop when there is a problem with your musculoskeletal system. They are frequently an indication of problems with your feet or ankles. Instability can also result in injuries to other parts of your body.
Some common orthopedic conditions that may cause instability in walking are:
Nerve damage
Muscle weakness
Multiple sclerosis
Parkinson's disease
Joint pain
Ankle sprains and fractures
Arthritis
The best way to identify the cause of your balance or mobility issues and find a solution, whatever they may be, is to see an orthopedic specialist.
11. Tingling Or Numb Hands And Feet
The ""pins and needles"" sensation or tingling hands, feet, or both is a very common and uncomfortable symptom. Sometimes this tingling is harmless and only lasts for a short period of time. For instance, it might be brought on by pressure on the nerves while you're dozing off if your arm is twisted underneath your head. Alternatively, it might result from prolonged leg crossing that puts pressure on the nerves.
However, tingling can frequently be severe or persistent. In addition, other symptoms like pain, numbness, itching, and muscle wasting may also accompany it. In these circumstances, tingling may be a symptom of nerve damage, which can be brought on by various conditions, including systemic illnesses like multiple sclerosis, diabetes, repetitive stress injuries, traumatic injuries, bacterial or viral infections, and exposure to toxic substances.
12. Pain On Repetitive Motion
Our joints can only withstand a certain amount of repetitive motion despite being designed to move. You might begin to experience joint pain if you have a physically demanding job or engage in a sport that involves repetitive movements.
This is particularly valid if the repetitive motion is performed incorrectly. Pain can also result from forceful exertions, awkward positions, and vibrating machines.
Overuse injuries are typical and include:
Golfer's elbow
Tennis elbow
Swimmer's shoulder
Bursitis
Tendonitis
Carpal tunnel syndrome
Injuries from repetitive motion commonly affect the shoulder, wrist, hand, and elbow. However, they can also happen in the back, neck, hip, and knee. It's crucial to take frequent breaks and stretch if you work a job or play a sport that requires repetitive motions. Any time you experience pain while engaging in a repetitive activity, you should seek out an orthopedic specialist.
Final Thoughts
A visit to an orthopedic physician may be necessary if you have persistent, recurrent, or unresponsive bone, joint, or muscle pain or swelling that can't be treated at home or if you have difficulty carrying out daily activities due to a significant reduction in the mobility or range of motion of a joint, such as your elbow, knee, or shoulder."
13,Radiology,"When Do You Need a Radiologist?
A radiologist will be involved in your care if your doctor needs assistance with imaging or certain specialized treatments.
Some common reasons you might need a radiologist are:
Broken bone
Torn muscle
Pregnancy
Screening for cancer or tumors
Blocked arteries or other vessels
Foreign objects in the body
Trauma and accidents
Infections
Depending on your procedure, your appointment can take just minutes or last 2 hours or more. You usually don’t need to prepare for your appointment. But some tests may require you to avoid certain foods, medications, and drinks beforehand.
Always tell the radiology office if you’re pregnant or trying to have a baby. X-rays and CT scans use low-dose radiation. Your doctor may want to use a different imaging test if possible in order to avoid exposing your baby to any possible harm.
X-ray. You’ve probably had your teeth X-rayed at your dentist’s. A medical X-ray is just as simple. You lie or stand and position yourself as asked. It’s over in minutes. You may get an X-ray after a car accident, or if you have trouble breathing, pneumonia, lung cancer, or other conditions.
CT scan. This gives a more detailed look at your body than X-rays. Beams of X-rays circle your body to view your organs, bones, and other parts from multiple angles. You’ll lie still on a padded table as it slides into a short, open-ended tunnel. Your radiologist may use it to check a complicated bone fracture, internal bleeding, infections, tumor size, and other reasons. For some CT scans, you may need to take a contrasting substance by mouth or IV to make the image clearer.
Related:
Ultrasound. It’s best known for taking pictures of babies in their mother’s womb. Ultrasounds use sound waves to help pinpoint heart damage, swelling, infection, tumors, and other things.
MRI. Instead of radiation, MRIs use radio waves and a magnetic field to peek inside your body. They allow your radiologist to better see soft tissue behind or inside your bones. It’s especially useful for scanning your brain and spinal cord, or for torn ligaments or tumors. Let your doctor know if you could be pregnant or if you have any metal parts or electronic implants, such as:
Pacemaker
Artificial knee or other joints
Dental fillings or bridges
Cochlear implant for hearing
Your technician may be able to adjust the procedure so that you can still get an MRI.
PET scan. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a type of nuclear medicine imaging. It uses a small bit of radioactive material to examine the inside of your body at the level of molecules. So PET scans may detect cancer or problems with your heart, brain, nerves, and elsewhere before other imaging tests can. Usually, you’ll need to stop eating and drinking anything other than water several hours before your procedure.
Other Types of Radiologists
Most radiologists help diagnose health problems. But others focus more on treatments.
Interventional radiologist. These doctors guide instruments through a small cut on your body where you need treatment. They might use a:
Needle to drain fluid
Tube for drainage or to deliver drugs or nutrition
Laser to remove fibroids or other growths
Stent, or tiny tube, to support a blood vessel
Balloon to clear out an artery (angioplasty)
Interventional radiologists sometimes take out tissue samples for examination with a microscope (biopsy) for cancer."
14,Nephrology,"Nephrologists are specialized physicians who diagnose, treat, and manage acute and chronic kidney conditions. Living with kidney conditions can be very difficult and affect one’s quality of life, so it’s always important to prioritize preventive kidney care when possible.
If you notice anything different or unusual happening with your bladder and kidneys, it may be time to see a nephrologist. Here are some symptoms to be on the lookout for:
Recurring UTIs
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by bacteria that enter the urethra and bladder and can eventually spread to the kidneys if left untreated. UTI symptoms include pressure in the lower pelvis, urinary urgency, inability to void urine, bladder pain, pain or burning during urination, frequent urination, and cloudy urine.
If you experience recurring or chronic UTIs, it’s time to see a nephrologist. They can run the right tests to make sure your kidneys are functioning properly and help determine the cause of the infections to protect your renal health.
Recurring Kidney Stones
Kidney stones are hard deposits of minerals and salts that form in the kidneys and eventually pass through the urinary tract. They usually do not cause symptoms until they pass through the urethra, which can include sharp pains in the side and back, below the ribs, that radiates to the lower abdomen and groin. This pain may come and go and vary in intensity, and you may experience pain or burning while urinating.
Other symptoms include dark and discolored urine, foul-smelling urine, urinary frequency, nausea, and fever or chills. Frequent kidney stones can be hinting at an underlying kidney issue that requires a nephrologist’s expertise. If a kidney stone doesn’t pass properly, it can lead to infection and may require surgical removal.
Signs of Kidney Disease
Kidney disease or renal failure is referred to as the ‘silent killer’ because the symptoms are not usually noticeable until the condition is advanced. By the time it is diagnosed in many patients, the only options in treatment are dialysis and kidney transplant. According to CDC data, 9 in 10 people living with kidney disease aren’t even aware they have it.
If you experience any combination of these symptoms, it’s time to see a nephrologist:
Hypertension or high blood pressure
Changes in urination
Edema or swelling (most often in the face, legs, or ankles)
Nausea, vomiting, and/or low appetite
Chronic fatigue or brain fog
A nephrologist (neh-frah-leh-jist) is a doctor with expertise in the care of kidneys. Your kidneys are part of your urinary system. They’re bean-shaped organs that filter your blood and remove waste, excess water and electrolytes, which leave your body as urine (pee).
A nephrologist diagnoses and treats kidney conditions and kidney failure. In addition, they also recognize how kidney conditions affect other parts of your body, including:
Autoimmune diseases.
Cardiovascular disease.
High blood pressure (hypertension).
Some of the most common conditions that a nephrologist may treat include:
Diabetic and other kidney diseases.
High blood pressure.
Kidney failure.
Cystic kidney disease.
Kidney stones.
Nephrotic syndrome.
End-stage renal (kidney) disease.
Hemolytic uremic syndrome.
Urinary tract infections (UTIs).
Kidney infections.
Hyponatremia and other electrolyte disorders.
Toxic overdoses that require dialysis.
Glomerulonephritis (GN).
What is the difference between a nephrologist and a urologist?
The differences between a nephrologist and a urologist may be confusing because their areas of expertise overlap a little.
Nephrologists specialize in conditions that affect your kidneys. A nephrologist is the best doctor to treat you if you have a condition that affects your kidneys or kidney function.
A urologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating conditions that affect your urinary system. Your urinary system includes your bladder, urethra, ureters and kidneys. They also specialize in conditions, symptoms and treatments that affect the male and female reproductive systems. A urologist is the best doctor to treat you if you have a condition affecting your urinary system or reproductive system.
Another key difference between a nephrologist and a urologist is that urologists have surgical training. Urologists only take care of kidney diseases that may require an intervention, like kidney cancer or kidney stones. Nephrologists don’t do surgery.
When should I see a nephrologist?
You should see a nephrologist if you have any symptoms of kidney disease. Signs of kidney disease may include:
Biological family history of kidney disease. If one of your direct genetic (biological) relatives has kidney disease, you may be at greater risk of kidney disease. A nephrologist can help prevent kidney disease or treat its earliest stages.
Diabetes. Diabetes can damage your kidneys. If you have diabetes, you are at a higher risk of kidney failure.
High blood pressure. High blood pressure can also damage your kidneys. Your kidneys use blood vessels to help filter waste and excess fluids from your blood. High blood pressure can make your blood vessels less elastic, which reduces blood and oxygen flow to your kidneys. Reduced blood and oxygen flow can cause kidney failure.
Changes in your pee. Changes in your pee or peeing habits may indicate a kidney condition. Signs may include peeing more often or less often, frothy pee or pee that’s darker in color.
Brain fog. Brain fog may be a symptom of kidney disease. It isn’t a medical condition, but your healthcare provider may use the term to describe slow or impaired thinking. You may be easily confused, forgetful or unable to focus.
Symptoms of Kidney Disease
In order to understand the more common symptoms of kidney disease, it's helpful to review the structure and function of the kidneys. Your kidneys are located on your flanks, near your spine. Injuries to your back or side below your diaphragm may cause injuries to your kidneys. Your kidneys perform several important functions. These include filtering your blood to remove toxins, maintaining the proper levels of electrolytes (such as sodium and potassium) to ensure proper functioning of your cells, and maintaining fluid balance in your body.
If you become dehydrated, your kidneys initially work to restore the fluid status to your body, but kidney injuries may occur with prolonged or severe dehydration. If your kidneys are not functioning properly, the level of sodium and potassium in your body may be affected. Electrolyte problems with kidney disease can be serious, Since the right amount of potassium is necessary for proper functioning of your heart, kidney problems may result in abnormal heart rhythms.2
Abnormal blood pressure, whether high or low can result in kidney damage. Kidney damage, in turn, can cause problems with regulating your blood pressure.
The kidneys are also responsible for making a hormone involved in the production of red blood cells. For this reason, kidney disease can result in anemia, a lower red blood cell count.
Some people have urinary problems, such as difficulty urinating. Occasionally people also have flank pain, due to the location of the kidneys.
Nonspecific or vague symptoms are common, and a reason why you should see your healthcare provider even if you can't precisely identify your symptoms. These may include fatigue, insomnia, or a metallic taste in your mouth. 
symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include:
Severe swelling (edema), particularly around your eyes and in your ankles and feet
Foamy urine, a result of excess protein in your urine
Weight gain due to fluid retention
Fatigue
Loss of appetite

15,Surgery,
16,Urology,"A urologist is a medical doctor specializing in conditions that affect the urinary tract in men, women and children, and diseases that affect the reproductive system. These conditions range from peeing too much or too little to being unable to father a child.
Bladder issues, pelvic pain, problems in the bedroom and other urologic symptoms aren't just inconvenient and uncomfortable. They can be seriously worrisome.
If you have concerns related to your urinary tract or sexual health, your first step may be to see your primary-care provider.
But if the issue requires further evaluation or treatment, the primary-care provider may refer you to a urologist.
What is a urologist?
A urologist is a specialist who provides medical treatment to both men and women experiencing problems of the:
Bladder
Kidneys
Urinary system
Reproductive systems
A urologist will review your symptoms, ask about your health history and perform a complete physical exam.
""Depending on your symptoms, we may order blood or urine labs, imaging studies, such as computed tomography ( CT) scans, or perform diagnostic procedures,"" a urologist at Houston Methodist.
When to see a urologist
Here are six signs you should consider seeing a urologist:
1. Urinary tract infections (UTIs)
Women who experience recurring UTIs (two or more infections in a six-month period or three or more episodes within a year) may be referred to a urologist for further evaluation.
""For men, any urinary tract infection is considered complicated and should be evaluated by a urologist,"" adds.
2. Incontinence issues
If you're experiencing urine leakage or the need to go frequently or urgently, a urologist can help.
""In many cases, lifestyle changes, medication or surgical treatments can improve your bladder symptoms,"" explains.
(Related: Will Urinary Incontinence Go Away on Its Own?)
3. Pelvic pain
Pelvic pain that doesn't go away is not normal and should be evaluated by a doctor.
Unexplained pelvic pain can be related to benign conditions or could be a warning sign of more serious diagnoses of the pelvic organs.
4. Kidney stones
Symptoms of kidney stones include:
Sharp pain in the lower abdomen, typically on one side
A burning sensation or pain while urinating
Urinating frequently
Feeling like you're urinating incompletely or in small amounts
Urine that is brown, red or pink, which indicates the presence of blood
Smelly or cloudy urine
Feeling queasy or nauseous due to the intensity of the pain
Signs of infection, including fever, chills and vomiting
""Any blood in the urine, in the absence of an infection, should be evaluated as soon as possible,"" notes.
5. Prostate problems
Men should see a urologist for issues such as:
Difficulty emptying the bladder
A weak stream
Painful urination
Blood in urine
These symptoms can be a sign of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also known as an enlarged prostate.
""Benign enlargement of the prostate can be treated with a combination of medications or minimally invasive surgical techniques,"" says.
6. Sexual dysfunction in men
Urologists are experts in sexual and reproductive health for men, including treatment of:
Low testosterone
Erectile dysfunction
Male infertility
Vasectomy (surgical contraception)
Erectile dysfunction. The conversation about erectile dysfunction has become common in recent years. This problem, which may affect up to 50% of adult males, is no longer something that gets brushed under the rug. We talk about it. Most men know that there are ways to treat this condition. However, because supplements and medications are available, some men may overlook the need to have erectile dysfunction evaluated by a urologist. This specialist can perform necessary tests to evaluate the physiology of the male reproductive system and potential hormonal or systemic involvement in the inability to keep or maintain an erection.
Kidney stones. Although men are more likely to develop kidney stones than women, this is not common knowledge, nor is what to do about this condition. The signs of kidney stones include abdominal, side, or back pain, nausea, vomiting, odd-smelling urine, and blood in the urine. A urologist can diagnose kidney stones based on symptoms but typically orders an ultrasound or other imaging to confirm stones, their type, and their measurements. In some cases, kidney stones can pass. Sometimes they need to be broken down into small pieces for this to happen.
Testicular pain. There are several reasons why a man may experience testicular pain. In adolescent males, sudden testicular pain may indicate testicular torsion, an event that requires emergency care. Adult males may experience testicular pain due to kidney stones, trauma to the testicle, infection, cysts, or other factors. A urologist can identify the cause of pain and administer appropriate treatment. Dr. Shridharani is one of few microsurgeons in the country who performs denervation surgery as a treatment for testicular pain.
In addition to these problems, men should see a urologist if they have tested high for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or demonstrate the signs of an enlarged prostate, such as a weak urine stream or difficulty urinating.
What conditions do urologists treat?
Urologists treat common conditions and rarer illnesses that affect everyone and some that affect only men or only women. Some of these conditions include:
Frequent urinary tract infections.
Inability to control urination (urinary incontinence).
Blood in the urine (hematuria).
Conditions of the male reproductive system, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH, or enlarged prostate).
Interstitial cystitis (painful bladder).
Urologists also treat other conditions, such as:
Cancers of the bladder, kidneys and prostate.
Erectile dysfunction (ED).
Kidney stones.
Pelvic organ prolapse.
Congenital urinary tract issues (problems with the urinary tract that you are born with).
Reasons you might see a urologist
You may make an appointment or get a referral to a urologist if you have:
Trouble urinating (peeing), including getting started or having a strong flow of urine, pain, cloudy urine or blood in the urine.
Changes in urination, like frequent urination or feeling like you always have to go.
Trouble getting or keeping an erection.
Infertility.
A feeling that something is falling down into your vagina or heaviness in that area.
Pelvic pain.
Urinating when you don’t want to, like at night or when you sneeze, laugh or exercise.
Changes in urination: Symptoms include blood in the urine, frequent urination, urine leakage and burning while or difficulty starting or stopping urinating.
Abdominal, back or side pain: Pain in these areas and changes in urination could be symptoms of a urinary condition. Kidney stones can cause blood in the urine and severe pain in the back or side. Ongoing pain or a feeling of heaviness along with blood in the urine could be signs of certain urinary cancers.
Male sexual health: Men may experience symptoms like trouble getting and keeping an erection and premature or delayed ejaculation.
Male infertility: About 50% of infertility for couples unable to conceive after one year may be due to conditions affecting the male reproductive system.
Pelvic pain and pressure: Men may experience pelvic pain from prostate issues. Women may experience pelvic pressure due to pelvic organ prolapse. Both men and women can experience pelvic pain because of an infection or inflammation in the urinary tract."
17,Endocrinology,"What is an endocrinologist?
An endocrinologist is a healthcare provider who specializes in endocrinology, a field of medicine that studies conditions related to your hormones. An endocrinologist can diagnose endocrine conditions, develop treatment and management plans for them and prescribe medication.
What is endocrinology?
Endocrinology is the study of hormones and endocrine glands and organs. Hormone-secreting glands and certain organs in your body make up your endocrine system.
A hormone is a chemical messenger that travels from one endocrine gland or organ in your body to another part of your body through your blood. Hormones help parts of your body communicate with other parts and have a large role in many key bodily functions, such as:
Metabolism (how your body transforms the food you eat into energy it can use).
Growth.
Sexual function and reproduction.
Sleep.
Your body makes and releases over 50 different hormones. Some of those hormones include:
Adrenaline.
Estrogen.
Growth hormone.
Insulin.
Melatonin.
Thyroid hormone.
Testosterone.
Certain glands in your body called endocrine glands make and release hormones. Glands are special tissues in your body that create and release substances. The endocrine glands in your body include:
Adrenal glands.
Parathyroid glands.
Pineal gland.
Pituitary gland.
Thyroid gland.
You have other glands in your body that aren’t endocrine glands, such as your sweat glands and lymph glands (also called lymph nodes).
Certain organs in your body also make and release hormones. An organ is a group of tissues that form a structure that performs specific important functions in your body. The organs that are part of the endocrine system include:
Pancreas.
Hypothalamus (this is a part of your brain, which is an organ).
Ovaries.
Testes.
What are the different kinds of endocrinologists?
An endocrinologist may specialize in certain areas of endocrinology called subspecialties, including:
Diabetes and metabolism: Many hormones play important roles in your metabolism — how your body transforms the food you eat into energy it can use. Diabetes is one of the most common metabolic conditions. An endocrinologist can specialize in the treatment of different kinds of diabetes and other metabolic conditions such as obesity.
Thyroid disease: Many conditions can affect your thyroid, the butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. An endocrinologist could specialize in these conditions specifically.
Endocrine oncology: An endocrinologist could specialize in cancers that affect your endocrine system. Oncology is a branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
Neuroendocrinology: This branch of endocrinology studies the interaction between your nervous system and your endocrine system. For example, it investigates how your brain controls the hormonal activity in your body.
Pediatric endocrinology: A pediatric endocrinologist specializes in treating children who have endocrine conditions. Some endocrine conditions affect children specifically, and others can affect both children and adults.
Gender affirmation: Gender affirmation can involve multidisciplinary treatment in which endocrinologists play an important role. Endocrinologists can specialize in sex hormone therapy, which is one aspect of gender affirmation.
Reproductive endocrinology: Many hormones are involved in sexual functions and reproduction. An endocrinologist could specialize in sexual function and fertility conditions. They may be referred to as fertility specialists.
Endocrinology nuclear medicine: This branch of endocrinology focuses on using nuclear medicine to treat certain endocrine conditions, especially thyroid conditions.
What does an endocrinologist treat?
An endocrinologist can diagnose and treat several different conditions that affect your endocrine system. This section will group several — but not all — conditions that endocrinologists treat into the following categories:
Diabetes and metabolic conditions.
Endocrine cancers and tumors.
Thyroid conditions.
Metabolic conditions.
Sexual development, function and reproduction conditions.
Calcium and bone conditions.
“There are several hormone-secreting organs in our bodies,” explains Mini Sara Cherian, MD, a RUSH Copley endocrinologist. “Problems can manifest as some very common symptoms, like fatigue and acne, hair loss, or menstrual irregularities. Often, when we evaluate a patient, we can trace the symptom back to dysfunction of one of those endocrine organs.”
An endocrinologist can treat you for a variety of conditions, including the following:
Diabetes: An endocrinologist can help you find the right education and care program to manage your diabetes, including medications and management of blood sugar. This can help prevent bigger complications such as heart disease, stroke and renal failure.
Thyroid disorder: The secretion of too much or too little hormone can cause osteoporosis, kidney stones, chronic fatigue and difficulty with memory and concentration along with symptoms including bone and joint pain, bone fractures, weight gain, muscle aches, dry skin and depression. Treatment may be as easy as taking a pill.
Hirsutism or excessive hair growth: Often visible on the face, chest and back, excessive hair growth in women is typically caused by hormones, like excess male hormones or low estrogen levels. An endocrinologist can successfully treat this condition with medication.
Infertility: If hormonal abnormalities are preventing you from conceiving and starting a family, an endocrinologist may be able to help with hormone treatments or medications.
Menopause: Common symptoms of menopause are hot flashes, night sweats, sleep disturbances, forgetfulness and irritability. An endocrinologist can help manage these symptoms.
If you have these conditions or any of the following symptoms, an endocrinologist can help.
Fatigue
Unexplained weight gain or loss
Anxiety or depression
New or increased hair growth
Changes in menstrual periods
Muscle weakness
Feeling cold
Hot flashes
Difficulty concentrating
Dry skin
Breaking hair
Bone or joint pain
Feeling jittery or shaky
Insomnia
Decreased sex drive
Conditions and test results that are among the topreasons to see an endocrinologist include:
Abnormal blood sugar levels, or symptoms such as excessive thirst, fatigue, weight gain or blurry vision: these are all symptoms of problems with insulin. This is a common reason to see an endocrinologist because your doctor may suspect diabetes—a condition that endocrinologists are best suited to manage.
Abnormal levels of thyroid hormone: it’s possible to have too much (hyperthyroidism) or too little (hypothyroidism) thyroid hormone in your system. Thyroid hormones regulate metabolism, so symptoms might include changes in weight (gain or loss). Other symptoms of thyroid problems include anxiety, hair loss, inability to handle cold temperatures or feeling cold all the time, an enlarged thyroid gland, or lumps that may indicate thyroid cancer. Your doctor may notice these endocrine disorders just by feeling your neck.
Low testosterone levels: fatigue, hair loss, depression, and weakness may indicate problems with testosterone in men.
Loss of bone density (osteoporosis): as we age, levels of sex hormones, particularly estrogen in women, decline and create conditions that make it difficult for our bones to replace old bone with new bone tissue. This elevates the risk of fractures. OB/Gyn practitioners typically recommend that post-menopausal women over 60 should have a bone density test. An endocrinologist can help manage the condition with medication, along with strength-building exercise and dietary supplements (taken under medical supervision.)
Irregular periods, excessive hair growth, cysts, difficulty getting pregnant, and metabolic problems: these may indicate Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, which an endocrinologist should assess.

18,Neurology,"A neurologist is a specialist who treats diseases in the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system), peripheral nerves (nerves connecting the brain and spine to the organs, like the lungs or liver), and muscles. Neurological diseases can include headaches; epilepsy; stroke; movement disorders, such as tremor or Parkinson’s disease; and many others. Read more below about the most common symptoms of neurological disease.
If you or a loved one has unexplained symptoms that could be related to the brain or nervous system, your doctor may recommend a neurological exam with a specialist.
Neurologists are specialists who treat diseases of the brain and spinal cord, peripheral nerves and muscles. Neurological conditions include epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease.
also commonly sees patients for:
Uncontrolled headaches
Memory loss
Imbalance
Numbness and pain
If you're experiencing these symptoms, you probably have a lot of questions.
Common reasons to visit a neurologist
""A thorough neurological exam is the most important tool I have as a neurologist,"" ""It can help differentiate and localize the causes of common complaints.""
these are the six signs that it is time to visit a neurologist.
Chronic or severe headaches
If you get migraine headaches, you should probably make an appointment with a neurologist, especially when the symptoms are associated with neurological deficits or tried treatments prove ineffective.
Chronic pain
When pain is chronic, and your primary care doctor can't help you manage it, you should consider a referral to a neurologist because there could be another underlying reason for the symptoms.
Dizziness
Experiencing vertigo (feeling like you're spinning) or having difficulty keeping your balance could be a sign of something more serious.
Numbness or tingling
Numbness or tingling, especially when it occurs on one side of the body or comes on suddenly, could be a sign of a stroke or other serious condition.
Movement problems
Difficulty walking, shuffling your feet, tremors and unintentional jerks, can all be signs of a nervous system problem.
Memory problems or confusion
Worsening memory problems, personality changes or mixing up words could be signs of Alzheimer's disease.
What to expect during a neurological exam
A neurologist can help identify the cause of symptoms and create a treatment plan for both common and complex neurological conditions.
During a neurological exam, instruments, such as lights and reflex hammers, may be used to assess the nervous system. Motor skills, balance, coordination and mental status may also be tested.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an example of a complex condition that may be best treated by a neurologist.
""MS has various forms, and the treatment options have changed significantly over recent years,"" says.
Patients can benefit from the expertise of a neurologist who is familiar with the latest research and treatment options for MS and other neurological conditions.
1. Headaches
Headaches are something we all experience. We can feel them stretching into our sinuses, across the top of our head, down through the muscles of the head, neck, and shoulders or along the base of the skull and brain. They can be caused by many conditions from a sinus infection to a throbbing toothache from a visit to the dentist.
Symptoms of more serious headaches, including migraines, may be vomiting, a headache that becomes more severe or is continuous, a headache that comes on suddenly or pain that is worsened by strain, a headache that starts early in the morning, changes in vision, or even seizures.
If your headache symptoms are severe enough, your primary care doctor may refer you to a neurologist.
2. Chronic pain
Chronic pain is pain that lasts for months or even years. This pain can be the result of illness or injury, but when it lasts longer than the usual recovery time, it can become a symptom of a different problem.
When this pain is not something your primary care physician can help you manage, you may choose to see a neurologist, especially if you have other symptoms along with the pain like weakness, numbness, or problems with bladder or bowel control.
3. Dizziness
Dizziness can come in different varieties. Neurologists treat dizziness that is a symptom of vertigo or disequilibrium. Vertigo makes you feel as if you or the things around you are spinning; disequilibrium is difficulty keeping your balance.
Your primary care doctor can help you decide if your dizziness is severe enough to see a neurologist.
4. Numbness or tingling
Numbness or tingling can happen for many different reasons, some as simple as sitting in a way that cuts off your blood circulation or having not eaten. However, if this numbness continues, comes on suddenly, or only happens on one side of the body, it may be time to see a neurologist.
Numbness or tingling symptoms like those described can also be signs of a stroke, in which case you need to get help very quickly. While your primary care doctor can help you evaluate these symptoms, if you think you are having a stroke, get immediate medical help.
5. Weakness
Feelings of weakness that you should see a doctor for are different than tiredness or muscle aches after a long hike or lifting too many weights. You should consult your provider if you experience muscle weakness that impacts your daily activities or a rapid decline in muscle strength, especially in your arms and legs. It could be caused by a more serious condition or disease of your nervous system, such as st/node/3651.
6. Movement problems
Problems moving, like difficulty walking, being clumsy, unintentional jerks or movements, tremors, or others, can be symptoms of a problem in your nervous system. You may want to see a neurologist if these movement problems interrupt your daily life, though something like a tremor can be a side effect of medication or anxiety. However, if your tremors also affect your daily activities, you may want to see a neurologist.
7. Seizures
Seizures can be almost unnoticeable or very extreme. Symptoms of seizures can range from staring to loss of consciousness, jerking movements of the arms and legs, breathing problems, confusion, or loss of consciousness.
While some seizures could be caused by low blood sugar or withdrawals from addictive substances, you should consult your provider for seizures that seem sudden or without any obvious cause. Your primary care doctor can help you determine how serious your seizure is and if you should see a neurologist.
8. Vision problems
Difficulty seeing can be caused by aging or by the nervous system. If the difficulty is sudden and happens in both eyes, you may want to have your vision evaluated. Either an eye doctor or your primary care doctor can advise you on whether you should see a neurologist about your vision problem.
9. Memory problems or confusion
Problems speaking, extreme problems with memory, changes in personality, or confusion are all symptoms that could be caused by disorders or problems in the brain, spine, and nerves. Some of the symptoms may be due to learning disabilities or they may be caused by a disease like Alzheimer’s.
Your primary care doctor can help you examine your symptoms and decide if you need to see a neurologist.
10. Sleep problems
While we know many obvious causes of sleep problems, going to bed too late, having a condition like sleep apnea or anxiety, nightmares, or others, some sleep problems are neurological disorders. An example of this is narcolepsy, which is a chronic, genetic disorder with no known cause that affects the body’s central nervous system.
Many of these symptoms could be part of a disorder that is not neurological. Your primary care doctor is your greatest resource in helping you decide if you should see a neurologist. However, if your symptoms are severe enough or you are still not confident in your primary care doctor’s recommendations, you may need to make an appointment with a neurologist.
1. Chronic headaches or migraines
We all experience headaches — of varying durations and severity — due to everything from staring at a computer screen too long to loud noise to lack of sleep to a sinus infection. While painful, most headaches are temporary. Usually, conservative treatments like over-the-counter pain medications will provide relief.
See a neurologist in these instances:
Your headaches become severe or disabling.
You’re taking medication for headaches daily.
You routinely wake up with a headache.
Your headaches are accompanied by other neurological symptoms, such as vision changes, dizziness, nausea or even seizures (if you start vomiting or lose consciousness, go to the emergency room right away).
Your headaches are severe and are accompanied by a sensitivity to light, strong smells or loud sounds, which could indicate migraines.
Your neurologist can help determine what’s causing your headaches — and any other symptoms — and help you get relief.
In addition to prescribing medications or treatments like Botox, emphasizes lifestyle modifications. “I always share tips with my patients,” she says. “For instance, I tell them to stay hydrated, don’t skip meals, avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol, engage in physical activity, and try relaxation therapy. All of those things can be helpful with headaches.”
So can sleep. “Headaches can be exacerbated by too little or too much sleep, or changes in your sleep routine,” . “That is actually true for many neurological conditions, so it’s important to practice good sleep hygiene if you’re having any sort of neurological issue.”
And if you’re having migraines, your neurologist can help you identify and avoid your triggers — including stress and certain foods — to prevent them.
2. Out-of-the-ordinary memory problems
Occasional forgetfulness, such as misplacing your keys or forgetting that your glasses are on top of your head, can be frustrating but probably isn’t a cause for concern.
“But if memory issues start interfering with work or your ability to function at home or take care of things at home, that’s a reason to see a neurologist,” . “We can determine the underlying cause, including ordering more specialized testing, if necessary.”
See a neurologist if you experience any of the following:
Difficulty speaking
Changes in personality
Confusion or disorientation
Frequent memory lapses
Repeating information or asking the same question multiple times
It’s important to note that not all memory problems are related to dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. Many things can cause memory issues, including certain medications, thyroid problems, poor sleep or fatigue, menopause, benign or cancerous tumors, stress or anxiety and alcohol use. Your neurologist will look at all potential factors that could be contributing to your memory loss.
If your symptoms are due to cognitive decline or dementia, your neurologist can work with you to try to prevent further memory loss with medications and lifestyle changes.
“The data shows that physical activity is critical, and we know that the Mediterranean and MIND diets both help to boost brain health. Social activity and mentally stimulating activities are also recommended,” .
3. Vertigo or balance issues
There are many reasons you might feel dizzy, lightheaded or off-kilter — for example, if you haven’t eaten all day, you’re overheated or you haven’t slept. Usually, these feelings go away once you take steps to address them. But certain types of dizziness can be a concern.
See a neurologist if you experience any of the following:
A feeling that either you or the world around you is spinning (vertigo)
Loss of balance or unsteadiness (disequilibrium)
Faintness or lightheadedness with no obvious cause
Feeling like you are falling or are going to fall
A floating sensation or dizziness
Sensitivity to motion
Vertigo or disequilibrium accompanied by other symptoms, including hearing or vision loss, ringing in your ears, ear pain or nausea
These symptoms can affect your quality of life, including your ability to work, and they should be evaluated by a neurologist even if they eventually go away on their own.
While dizziness or balance problems are often related to inner ear (vestibular) issues and are not life-threatening, a diagnosis will enable you to get treatment for the underlying condition. This can both prevent vertigo or disequilibrium from coming back and keep the condition itself from worsening.
If the cause is something more serious, like cardiovascular disease, acoustic neuroma (a rare noncancerous tumor), a head injury or a neurological condition like Parkinson’s disease, your neurologist can coordinate with other specialists to make sure you get the care you need.
4. Unusual spells or seizures
When you think of a seizure, you probably imagine a person lying on the ground convulsing. Seizures aren’t always that obvious, but any seizure is concerning.
See a neurologist if you or a loved one experience any of the following but have not been diagnosed with a seizure disorder like epilepsy:
Violent shaking
Uncontrollable stiffening of the body, especially the arms and legs
Staring spells (the person isn’t connecting or responding, or seems to be daydreaming)
Confusion or disorientation after a seizure (the person doesn’t appear to be “coming out” of the seizure)
Loss of bowel or bladder control
Falling for no apparent reason
Loss of consciousness
“While many types of epilepsy are present during infancy and childhood, you can experience the onset of epilepsy as an adult,” . “A seizure can also be a symptom of another potentially serious condition.”
Testing can determine whether the cause of a seizure is epilepsy or something else, such as meningitis, low blood glucose levels, very high blood pressure, kidney or liver failure, stroke or a vascular abnormality in the brain.
“It’s important to get a diagnosis so you can receive the appropriate treatment,” . Some people may have one seizure and never experience another, but untreated seizures can also worsen over time, becoming more frequent and longer in duration. Even seemingly minor seizures aren’t harmless; they can cause lasting brain damage or lead to injuries if you fall or are driving when one occurs. They can also affect your quality of life.
5. Numbness or weakness
You may experience numbness or tingling in your arms, hands, legs or feet for many reasons, like that “pins and needles” feeling you get when you sit too long, or when your circulation gets cut off from wearing something tight.
Similarly, there may be times when your muscles feel weak, such as after a grueling workout or when you have a virus like the flu.
Occasional, short-term numbness and weakness are typically harmless. If they linger or if they come on suddenly for no apparent reason, the issue may be something more worrisome — from thyroid disease to a neuromuscular disorder to a herniated disc to the West Nile virus.
See a neurologist if you experience the following, especially if you have a family history of neurological issues:
Numbness or weakness that comes on suddenly or happens on one side of the body (if you think you are having a stroke, however, go to the emergency room or call 911 immediately)
Persistent (over weeks or months) or worsening numbness
Chronic muscle weakness or a rapid decline in muscle strength
A weak handgrip that’s affecting your ability to eat, write or perform other daily activities
Foot drop, or difficulty lifting the front of your foot, which may cause it to drag
Lingering numbness and/or weakness after a stroke or injury
Numbness and/or weakness accompanied by other neurological symptoms, such as nerve pain or burning
6. Sleep problems
If your snoring is keeping your family up at night (a sign you might have obstructive sleep apnea), a neurologist probably can’t help you — though a sleep specialist may be able to help. But some sleep problems are neurological, like idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy; commonly associated with neurological conditions; or side effects of medications used to treat neurological conditions.
See a neurologist if you experience any of the following:
Prolonged periods of excessive tiredness during the day after getting a full night’s sleep
Frequently falling asleep in relaxing surroundings
Frequent difficulty falling or staying asleep, especially if you are also having nightmares
Sleep problems following the diagnosis of a neurological condition, such as Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, a movement disorder or a neuromuscular disorder
One sleep issue, in particular, should always be evaluated by a neurologist: REM sleep behavior disorder.
“That’s when you act out your dreams,” . “These tend to be more violent dreams — so you’re kicking, fighting or even screaming in your sleep. Your bed partner may get hurt when you lash out, or you may fall out of bed. You’ll likely recall the dream but not your physical response to it.”
If you notice this behavior in a family member or friend, encourage them to see a neurologist. Not only do common causes include traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder, but REM sleep behavior disorder is one of the strongest early indicators of developing Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies or multiple system atrophy.
“Typically, the dream enactment precedes a Parkinson’s diagnosis by 15 to 20 years,”. A neurologist can help confirm or rule out the potential causes so you can get the proper care.
“As neurologists, we may not always find the ultimate cause of your symptoms, but often we’re able to eliminate the more serious conditions,” . “And if we do detect something concerning, it can then be treated appropriately — we either treat it ourselves or send you to the right specialist. When I show people their MRI and other test results, they feel a lot of relief when it turns out there’s nothing to be concerned about.”"
